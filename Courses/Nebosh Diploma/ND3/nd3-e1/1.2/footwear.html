    <p>
      ‘Sensible footwear’ policies, specifying flat shoes to maximise sole /
      floor contact and friction, have been shown to be effective in reducing
      the numbers of slip incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sole tread pattern and sole compound are both important for slip
      resistance. Generally a softer sole and close-packed tread pattern work
      well with fluid contaminants and indoor environments. A more open pattern
      works better outdoors or with solid contaminants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The safety features of footwear, including slip resistance, are tested
      according to a set of European test standards written into BS EN ISO
      20345:2011 – Personal protective equipment. Safety footwear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Footwear which has passed the EN test for slip resistance is marked as:

    <p>
      Flooring should be specified to ensure that it has sufficient slip
      resistance to cope with its intended use (notes on slip resistance
      follow).
    </p>
    <p>
      The junctions between floor surfaces of different slip resistance should
      be visually obvious. A pedestrian going from a high to low friction
      surface is more likely to slip if they do not adjust their gait
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horizontal floors are inherently less slippery than sloping floors with
      the same surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to its dry slip resistance other parameters to consider in
      specifying a suitable floor material include:

    <p>
      Depending on the levels of liquid, or other contamination, expected the
      floor finish may need to be ‘macro-rough’, i.e. exhibit visible, moulded
      patterns or profiles within the finish, or ‘micro rough’, which although
      seemingly flat will incorporate microscopic particles or patterns to
      increase friction and improve slip resistance.
