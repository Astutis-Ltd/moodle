    <p>
      In 2019 / 20 slips and trips accounted for 29% of all RIDDOR reported
      non-fatal injuries (over 200 000 reports). Slips and trips are estimated
      to account for around one million lost work days per year in the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
      HSE statistics suggest that most of these accidents are slips, most of
      which occur when floor surfaces are contaminated with water, talc, or
      grease, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Slips</span> occur when the foot and floor cannot
      make effective contact, usually when something has been spilled, or when
      the shoe sole and floor finish are incompatible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Trips</span> occur when an obstruction prevents
      normal movement of the foot resulting in loss of balance, usually caused
      by objects on the floor or uneven surfaces.

      The image below shows a slip / trip potential model which identifies the
      relative importance of the factors contributing to slips and trips.
