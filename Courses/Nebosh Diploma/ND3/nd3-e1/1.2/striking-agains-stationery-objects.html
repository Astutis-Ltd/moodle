      Workrooms should have enough free space to allow people to get to and from
      workstations, and to move safely and comfortably within the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minimum of 11 cubic metres of space should be allowed for each worker in
      a work room. In a typical room, where the ceiling is 2.4m high this
      equates to a floor area of 4.6m2 per person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The legal requirement in the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare)
      Regulation (Regulation 10) is for ‘sufficient unoccupied space’ so these
      figures may be inadequate if much of the space is filled with furniture or
      other fixtures and fittings.

    <p>
      Transparent / translucent surfaces should also be conspicuously marked, at
      a suitable height, to prevent people accidentally walking into them.
