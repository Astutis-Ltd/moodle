      The workplace should be properly designed, in the first instance, to
      ensure adequate space, planned walkways and adequate lighting.

    <p>
      Contamination is not limited to liquids. Dust or loose particulate can
      also cause slip hazards, due to loss of grip. Obstructions from lack of
      storage or poor housekeeping create the corresponding trip hazard.
      Required precautions include:

    <p>
      Floors likely to be used by ‘high risk’ groups (such as the very young,
      the very old, disabled or infirm) should offer a greater slip resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Floors used for transporting significant loads, by pulling or pushing,
      should also offer a greater frictional resistance, as workers will need
      good traction to gain momentum. Monitoring for wear and tear will also be
      important.

    <p>
      Inappropriate behaviour such as running or horseplay can be a major
      contributing factor in a slip on an otherwise safe floor. Managers should
      look to lead by example, demonstrating expected behaviours. They should
      also ensure that:
