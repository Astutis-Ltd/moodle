      The
      <span class="ast-italic">
        Workplace (Health Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992</span
      >
      require employers to protect employees and others from a range of hazards
      as they move around the workplace. The hazards and the relevant
      requirements are summarised in the table below.

              Regulation 12 requires that floor and traffic routes should be of
              sound construction, adequate strength and stability. They should
              be free from any hole, slope, or uneven or slippery surface which
              is likely to cause a person to slip, trip or fall, or drop
              anything being lifted or carried.

              be securely covered rather than fenced. <br />

              (Regulations 10 and 11) <br /><br />Glazed door panels, windows
              and partitions should be made from safety materials, and should be
              conspicuously marked if necessary to prevent people walking into
              them. (Regulation 14)

      Other requirements of the regulations regarding adequate lighting
      (discussed later), cleanliness and storage of waste also help to ensure
      the safe movement of people.
