      The hazards and precautions for controlling the risks from working at
      height are discussed in more detail in Element 11.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secure fencing should normally be provided to prevent people falling from
      edges, and to also prevent objects falling onto people below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fencing should be sufficiently high and filled in to prevent falls (of
      people or objects) over, or through, the fencing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a minimum, fencing should consist of two guard-rails (a top rail and a
      lower rail) at suitable heights, with toe boards or up-stands provided to
      prevent falling objects.
    </p>
    <p>Tanks or pits may be covered instead of fenced. Covers should:</p>

    <p>Safe movement of vehicles is discussed in more detail in Element 12.</p>
    <p>
      Any traffic route which is used by both pedestrians and vehicles should be
      wide enough to enable any vehicle likely to use the route to pass
      pedestrians safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vehicles should be separated from pedestrians in doorways, gateways,
      tunnels, bridges, and other enclosed routes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where pedestrian and vehicle routes cross, appropriate crossing points
      should be provided and used.
