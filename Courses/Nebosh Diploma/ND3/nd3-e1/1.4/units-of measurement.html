      The candela is the SI unit of luminous intensity. It is equal to one lumen
      per steradian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically one candela was the amount of visible light emitted by one
      standard candle in a given direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operational definition of a candela, as defined by the 16th General
      Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 1979, is:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        “the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits
        monochromatic radiation of frequency 540×1012 hertz and that has a
        radiant intensity in that direction of 1⁄683 watt per steradian.”

    <p>
      The Lumen is the SI unit of luminous flux, used in describing a quantity
      of light emitted by a source or received by a surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lumen was created as the measure of total luminous power (i.e. visible
      light power) as defined by a set of ideal human eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      One lumen is defined as one candela-steradian (cd sr), or the amount of
      light power needed to send 1 candela of light in all directions.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The Lux (lx) is the SI unit of illuminance or luminous flux per unit area.
      It is a measure of the intensity, as perceived by the human eye, of light
      that hits or passes through a surface.
    </p>
    <p>One lux is equal to one lumen per square metre.</p>
    <p>
      It is analogous to the radiometric unit watts per square metre, but with
      the power at each wavelength weighted according to the luminosity function
      (a standardized model of human visual brightness perception).

        Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992</span
      >
      cross refers to specific HSE guidance - HSG38 “Lighting at work “ and a

      Engineers (CIBSE).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then the Society of Light and Lighting (SLL), a specialist division
      of CIBSE has reviewed and updated the guidance and published a series of
      21 SLL Lighting Guides, and other technical content.
