    <p>
      Markings consisting of equally sized yellow and black (or red and white)
      stripes at an angle of 45 degrees may be used for marking obstacles and
      dangerous locations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traffic route markings take the form of continuous lines, preferably
      yellow or white, taking into account the colour of the ground.

    <p>
      An illuminated sign is made of transparent or translucent materials, which
      is illuminated from the inside or the rear to give the appearance of a
      luminous surface. Emergency exit signs are an example of an illuminated
      sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      An illuminated sign has to be bright enough to be seen, without causing
      glare.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flashing sign may be used to indicate a higher level of danger or a more
      urgent need for intervention or action.

      <p>Acoustic signal</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      An acoustic signal is a sound signal which is transmitted without the use
      of a human or artificial voice. An example of an acoustic signal is a fire
      alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acoustic signals need to be loud enough to be heard â€“ usually 10 dB(A)
      above ambient at any given frequency.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the signal can operate at alternating frequencies (like a two-tone
      siren) it may be operated in that mode to indicate a higher level of
      danger, or a more urgent need for intervention or action.
    </p>

    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Spoken communication</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Spoken communication in this instance refers to a predetermined spoken
      message communicated by a human or artificial voice. Spoken messages need
      to be clear, concise, and understood by the listener.
