    <p>
      The use of electricity can generate hot surfaces or sparks which can
      ignite an explosive atmosphere. An explosive atmosphere could be present
      in a variety of different places including paint spray booths, near fuel
      tanks, in sumps, or many places where aerosols, vapours, mists, gases, or
      dusts exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Electrical and non-electrical equipment and installations in potentially
      explosive atmospheres must be specially designed and constructed so that
      the risks of ignition are eliminated or reduced. Techniques to do this
      include:

          Recently installed equipment should be marked with an ‘Ex’ to show it
          is suitable for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. All new
          equipment must comply with
          <span class="ast-italic">
            The Equipment and Protective Systems Intended for Use in Potentially
            Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 1996

          (EPS) that implements the European ATEX Directive. This requires it to
          be assessed as suitable for a particular explosive atmosphere type,
          and for this to be marked on the equipment along with CE and ATEX
          markings. Most new equipment being sold in the UK for use in
          potentially explosive atmospheres must have an ATEX certificate.

    <p>
      Equipment for use in explosive atmospheres should be regularly inspected
      and maintained as per BS EN 60079-17:2014: Explosive atmospheres.
      Electrical installations inspection and maintenance to ensure it does not
      pose an increased risk of causing a fire or explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Work on electrical equipment in explosive atmospheres must be carefully
      planned and controlled to manage the risk of fire and explosion. A
      Permit-To-Work (PTW) provides an appropriate framework for managing such
      work, and ensuring that all necessary precautions are in place.
    </p>
    <p>Following Brexit, the UK now has its own marking system.</p>
    <p>
      UKCA for Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales), which includes UKCA
      Ex (UKEX) marking requirements for products used in explosive atmospheres.
      This replaces ATEX in Great Britain, though the requirements for UKEX are
      similar to those in the ATEX directive. A UK Approved Body must assess and
      certify products under the UKEX scheme.
