    <p>Hazardous areas are defined in DSEAR as:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        … any place in which an explosive atmosphere may occur in quantities

    <p>
      Area classification is a method of analysing and classifying the
      environment where explosive gas atmospheres may occur. The main purpose is
      to facilitate the proper selection and installation of apparatus to be
      used safely in that environment, taking into account the properties of the
      flammable materials that will be present.
    </p>
    <p>
      DSEAR specifically extends the original scope of this analysis, to take
      into account non-electrical sources of ignition, and mobile equipment that
      creates an ignition risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazardous areas are classified into zones based on an assessment of the
      frequency of the occurrence and duration of an explosive gas atmosphere,
      as follows:

      When the hazardous areas of a plant have been classified, the remainder
      will be defined as non-hazardous or ‘safe’ areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The zone definitions take no account of the consequences of a release. If
      this aspect is important, it may be addressed by upgrading the
      specification of equipment or controls over activities allowed within the
      zone.
