    <p>
      All chemical reactions involve a transfer of energy to or from chemicals.
      This is critical not only in industrial chemistry but also in the
      reactions of life itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many chemical reactions, energy is given out by reactants as they form
      products, causing the temperature of the surroundings to rise. These
      reactions are exothermic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the blast furnace, blasts of hot air at 750°C are blown into the base
      and start a reaction between coke and oxygen:

      </div>
    </div>
    <!--Blue Box End-->
    <p>
      The reaction is highly exothermic and raises the temperature at the base
      of furnace to about 2000°C. This is because the stored energy (or enthalpy
      – symbol H) in carbon and oxygen is greater than the stored energy in
      carbon dioxide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enthalpy changes (ΔH) can easily be found by measuring temperature during
      reactions at constant pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the coke and oxygen reaction, 394 kJ (kilojoules) of energy is released
      for every mole of carbon that reacts.

      Endothermic reactions are the opposite of exothermic reactions. In an
      endothermic reaction energy is taken in by the reactants to form products.
      The energy comes from the surroundings which lose energy and cool down,
      resulting in a drop in temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the blast furnace the carbon dioxide produced at the base reacts with
      more coke to produce carbon monoxide. This is an endothermic reaction.

      Carbon monoxide taking in energy as it is formed is one of the reasons why
      the blast furnace becomes cooler towards the top.

      <p>Thermal runaway reactions</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->

    <p>
      Thermal runaway begins when the heat produced by an exothermic reaction
      exceeds the heat removed. The surplus heat raises the temperature of the
      reaction mass, which causes the rate of reaction to increase, which in
      turn accelerates the rate of heat production.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule of thumb the reaction rate, and hence the rate of heat
      generation, may be considered to double with every 10°C rise in
      temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the temperature increases, the rate at which heat is produced increases
      exponentially, whereas the rate at which heat is removed increases
      linearly.
    </p>

    <img
      src="https://mylearning.astutis.com/draftfile.php/524/user/draft/471745068/cgdi0506_heat_production_versus_heat_removal%20V2.jpg"
      alt=""
      class="ast-img"
    />

    <p>
      The heat produced increases with the volume of the reaction mixture,
      whereas the heat removed depends on the surface area available for heat
      transfer. As scale and the ratio of volume to surface area increases,
      cooling can become inadequate. This is a particularly important factor
      when scaling-up processes from laboratory to production, and when
      modifying a process to increase the reaction quantities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once control of the reaction is lost, the temperature rises rapidly
      leaving little time for correction. The reaction vessel may be at risk
      from over-pressurisation, due to violent boiling or rapid gas generation,
      and the elevated temperatures may initiate secondary, more hazardous
      runaways or decompositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      At best, a runaway causes loss and disruption of production, at worst it
      may result in a major accident. The harmful effects could include:
