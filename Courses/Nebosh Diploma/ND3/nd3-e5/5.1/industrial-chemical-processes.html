      Industrial chemistry is the science of developing, optimising and
      monitoring the chemical processes used in industry for transforming raw
      materials and precursors into primary bulk chemicals, and ultimately into
      secondary commercial products for use in society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chemical equations are used to understand, describe and balance reactions
      so that production yields and reaction rates can be optimised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principles of iron and steel-making have not changed much since Roman
      times. The process is simple and uses four major raw materials: iron ore,
      coke (from coal), limestone and air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Industrial chemists calculate the exact amounts of raw materials required
      and advise on the best reaction conditions to ensure efficient, effective,
      production.

      In a blast furnace, haematite (iron III oxide – Fe <sub>2</sub> O
      <sub>3</sub> ) reacts with carbon monoxide (CO) to produce carbon dioxide
      (CO <sub>2</sub> ) and iron (Fe).
    </p>
    <p>
      Balancing the equation shows that one molecule of haematite reacts with
      three molecules of carbon monoxide to produce two atoms of iron and three
      molecules of carbon dioxide.

    <p>
      Once the amounts of the chemical substances in the equation are known, the
      masses of the substances involved can be determined using the relative
      atomic mass (Ar) scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately the yield of iron from a mass of haematite can be determined,
      as an example ten tonnes of haematite will yield approximately 7 tonnes of
      iron, under optimal conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual yield is likely to be a fraction of the theoretical ideal, as
      reactions may not be completed in the time available, and product may be
      lost during the process. The closer the percentage yield is to 100% the
      more efficient the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Economical production is not just dependent upon the yield. The rate of
      reaction is equally important – the quicker the iron is made the quicker
      it can be sold or used in steel making.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rate of a reaction can be controlled by changing the conditions of the
      reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Increasing the collision rate between particles will increase the rate of
      reaction. The key variables are:

    <p>
      Changing temperature, pressure, concentration and surface area may also
      reduce the yield of the process, so there is often a compromise between
      rates of reaction and yield, with the aim of maximising the profit from
      the process.
