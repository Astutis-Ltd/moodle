      An analysis of thermal runaways in the UK has indicated that incidents
      occur because of:

    <p>
      A chemical process risk assessment is required to identify chemical
      reaction hazards, and to determine how likely they are to occur and how
      serious their consequences would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the process design develops, foreseeable deviations from the normal
      process, such as equipment failure or operator error, should be
      considered. A structured method for identifying hazards, such as a HAZard
      and OPerability study (HAZOP) can be particularly useful when the plant or
      processes are highly hazardous, complex or involve new technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Determining the hazards of a reaction requires information on the
      chemistry and thermochemistry of the reaction, including:

      Competent advice is essential in ensuring that suitable test methods are
      selected and the results are correctly interpreted.
