      <p>Bhopal 1984 – disaster caused by thermal runaway</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      On the 3 December 1984 a relief valve on a storage tank containing Methyl
      IsoCyanate (MIC – CH3NCO) lifted releasing a cloud of highly toxic MIC gas
      which drifted onto nearby housing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approximately 2 000 people died within a short period and tens of
      thousands were injured, overwhelming the emergency services. The exact
      numbers of dead and injured are uncertain, as people have continued to die
      of the effects over a period of years. The severity of the incident makes
      it the worst recorded within the chemical industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      MIC is a highly reactive intermediate chemical that Union Carbide used to
      manufacture various pesticides. MIC reacts exothermically with a variety
      of potential contaminants including rust and particularly water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MIC produced at the factory was stored in two stainless steel storage
      tanks. Stainless steel is inherently safe choice for the tank material. It
      eliminates the reactivity hazard associated with carbon steel – rust /
      iron oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is a catalyst for the exothermic
      MIC trimerisation process that converts gaseous or liquid MIC into the
      solid MIC trimer (a cyclical molecule made of three identical MIC
      molecules) and gives rise to a nuisance deposit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would seem that exothermic runaway reaction was caused by the unique
      combination of large amounts of water (120 to 240 gallons) together with
      chloroform and iron oxide. The MIC itself was stored at a higher than
      specified temperature as the refrigeration system had been shut down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The runaway reaction led to an increased temperature and pressure within
      the tank causing the ceramic seal to the pressure relief valve to shatter
      and release a cloud of MIC vapour into the atmosphere. The ceramic seal
      was considered an upgrade to the previous carbon steel one as it
      eliminated the potential catalytic effect of iron oxide, unfortunately the
      materials could not withstand the pressures that built up as a result of
      the runaway reaction).

      <p>T2 Laboratories, Jacksonville Florida 19 December 2007</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->

    <p>
      On 19 December 2007, four people were killed and 13 others were
      transported to the hospital when an explosion occured at T2 Laboratories
      Inc. during the production of a gasoline additive called
      MethylCyclopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl (MCMT).
    </p>
    <p>
      The laboratory facilities were destroyed in the explosion, other buildings
      were damaged up to a quarter mile radius and reactor debris was found a
      mile away.
    </p>
    <p>
      T2 was producing its 175th batch of MCMT. At 13:23, the process operator
      noticed a cooling problem and called for the owner to be contacted and
      requested to return to the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later, at 13:33, the reactor burst and its contents
      exploded, killing the owner and process operator who were in the control
      room and two outside operators who were exiting the reactor area.
    </p>
    <p>
      A runaway exothermic reaction occurred during the first (metalation) step
      of the MCMT process. The most likely cause of which was deemed to be a
      loss of sufficient cooling during the process leading to an uncontrollable
      pressure and temperature rise which burst the reactor. The reactor’s
      contents then ignited, creating an explosion equivalent to 0.7 tonnes of
      TNT.
    </p>
    <p>
      The root cause of the accident was the failure of T2 to recognize the
      runaway reaction hazard associated with the MCMT it was producing.
    </p>
    <p>The main contributing causes were that:</p>
