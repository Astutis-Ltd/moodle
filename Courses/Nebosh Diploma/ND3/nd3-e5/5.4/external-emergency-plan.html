    <p>
      The external emergency plan should be based around the major accident
      hazards (identified by the operator in the safety report), which could
      affect people and the environment outside the boundary of the
      establishment, or which will require the attendance of emergency services
      from outside the establishment if an emergency arises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan should concentrate on those events identified as being most
      likely to occur. The level of planning should be proportional to the
      probability of the accident occurring. The plan should have the
      flexibility to allow it to be extended and increased to deal with
      extremely unlikely consequences which may arise through combinations of
      accidental circumstances and weather conditions.

    <p>
      The competent authority will inform a local authority of the duty to
      produce an off-site emergency plan for a CoMAH establishment within its
      area.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operator has to provide the local authority with the necessary
      information about the nature, extent and likely effects of reasonably
      foreseeable major accidents, in sufficient detail to help prepare the
      off-site emergency plan. The operator should keep a record of the
      information supplied to the local authority, the source of the information
      and how it will be reviewed, revised and updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The local authority can request any additional information that it may
      reasonably require for the preparation of the off-site emergency plan. The
      local authority may use consultants or other appropriate staff when
      preparing the off-site emergency plan. Local authority emergency planning
      staff will produce plans in liaison with the CoMAH establishment staff,
      the competent authority, the emergency services, the health authority and
      appropriate members of the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emergency planning officers provide the focus within the community for
      carrying out local authority civil protection responsibilities in close
      co-operation with the emergency services, local authority departments, and
      industrial and commercial organisations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emergency services have duties to deal with accidents and emergencies
      of all sorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CoMAH external emergency plan is principally a tool to co-ordinate the
      existing emergency servicesâ€™ plans, as far as possible, in their
      preparation for dealing with the specific hazards and risks associated
      with accidents on major hazard establishments.
