      Major accident is defined in the Control of Major Accident Hazard
      Regulations 2015 (CoMAH) as:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        … an occurrence (including in particular, a major emission, fire or
        explosion) resulting from uncontrolled developments in the course of the
        operation of any establishment and leading to serious danger to human
        health or the environment, immediate or delayed, inside or outside the
        establishment, and involving one or more dangerous substances
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      The cyclohexane release at Flixborough in 1974, and the dioxin release
      from the ICMESA plant at Seveso in Italy in 1976, was the major catalysts
      for legislating for planning for major accident prevention and control.
      The EC Seveso I Directive and the work of the Advisory Committee on Major
      Hazards (ACMH) in the UK led to the introduction of the Control of Major
      Industrial Accident Hazards 1984 (CiMAH), which were superseded by the
      Seveso II Directive and the CoMAH Regulations 1999. The Seveso III
      Directive came into force on 1 June 2015, replacing the Seveso II
      Directive. To implement this Directive, the CoMAH Regulations 1999 (as
      amended) have been revoked and replaced by the CoMAH Regulations 2015.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main aim of the CoMAH Regulations is to prevent and mitigate the
      effects of those major accidents involving dangerous substances, such as
      chlorine, LPG or explosives, which can cause serious damage/harm to people
      and/or the environment. Risks to the environment are treated as seriously
      as those to people.
    </p>
    <p>
      A key feature of CoMAH is that the Regulations are enforced by a competent
      authority, comprising HSE and the Environment Agency (EA), in England and
      Wales, and HSE and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) in
      Scotland. The competent authority bodies work jointly and usually provide
      a single response on all matters to do with CoMAH.
    </p>
    <p>
      An establishment is subject to CoMAH if it produces, uses, handles or
      stores on site any dangerous substance specified in Schedule 1 of the
      Regulations, above a qualifying quantity. Part 1 of Schedule 1 lists named
      substances and thresholds. Part 2 lists thresholds for other substances
      that are not named but are classified as dangerous for supply under CLP.
    </p>
    <p>
      Establishments with quantities equal to or greater than the upper
      threshold are known as upper-tier establishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Establishments with lower quantities, but which are equal to or greater
      than the lower threshold, are known as lower-tier establishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, the thresholds for liquefied extremely flammable gas,
      including LPG and natural gas (whether liquefied or not) are as follows:
    </p>

      Note: The thresholds are ‘anticipated’ rather than actual, and must take
      account of stock fluctuations and loss of containment or process control.

      Part 3 (Safety Reports for Upper Tier Establishments) and Part 4
      (Emergency Plans for Upper Tier Establishments) of CoMAH only apply to top
      tier sites. The emergency planning requirements are laid down in
      Regulations 12 to 16 and Schedule 4:
