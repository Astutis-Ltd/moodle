    <p>
      An emergency as defined in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 is a situation
      or series of events that threatens or causes serious damage to human
      welfare, the environment or security in the United Kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a local authority emergency planning perspective, a major emergency
      is any event (happening with or without warning) causing or threatening
      death or injury, damage to property or the environment or disruption to
      the community which, because of the scale of its effects, cannot be dealt
      with by the emergency services and local authority as part of their
      day-to-day activities.

    <p>
      The UK Cabinet Office considers it essential that all organisations have
      effective, well-practiced emergency plans in place. Emergency planning
      should aim, where possible, to prevent emergencies occurring. When they do
      occur, good planning should reduce, control or mitigate the effects of the
      emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emergency planning is a systematic and on-going process that should be
      viewed as part of a cycle of activities. It should begin with establishing
      a risk profile to help determine what should be the priorities for
      developing plans, and conclude with review and revision, before
      re-starting the whole cycle.

          Plans should focus on the following three key groupings of people:

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Vulnerable people, who are less able to help themselves in an
          emergency than self- reliant people

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Victims of an emergency, including those suffering bereavement or the
          anxiety of not knowing what has happened
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Responder personnel, whose welfare should be given due consideration
          in the planning process
        </li>

    <p>
      Much of the work for preventing emergencies will have been done in earlier
      risk management activities. At this stage the emphasis is on early
      recognition of the signs of an escalating event, and the taking of prompt
      decisive action to prevent the emergency event occurring.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The main bulk of planning should consider how to minimise the effects of
      an emergency, starting with the impact of the event (such as alerting
      procedures) and looking at remedial actions that can be taken to reduce
      effects. The evacuation of people may be one direct intervention which can
      mitigate the effects of some emergencies. Recovery plans should also be
      developed to reduce the effects of the emergency and ensure long term
      recovery.
