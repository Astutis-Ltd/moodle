      in line with the health service arrangements for dealing with chemical
      incidents under the Ambulance Service Association guidelines. Individual

      The on-going maintenance of the emergency plan is as important as its

      time if an emergency occurs.

      Regulation 14 of CoMAH requires that at least once every three years the
