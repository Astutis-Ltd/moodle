      Once dangerous goods have been classified correctly the packaging
      requirements laid out in part 4 of ADR can be applied (Part 6 of ADR
      details the requirements for the construction, and testing of packaging
      and tanks).
    </p>
    <p>
      The international agreements for the carriage of dangerous goods require
      packaging to be of a design-type certified by a national competent
      authority. This involves testing the packaging to ensure its suitability
      for the carriage of certain dangerous goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases packaging has to be certified to UN standards. Such
      packaging is often referred to as ‘type-approved’ or ‘UN certified’. Such
      packaging is marked in particular ways, prefixed by the UN logo and
      followed by codes.
