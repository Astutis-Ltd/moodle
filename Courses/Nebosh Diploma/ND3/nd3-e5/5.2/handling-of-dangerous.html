    <p>
      Flammable liquids should ideally be handled in enclosed systems, using
      pipework, pumps and closed vessels. The equipment should be suitable for
      the liquids being handled, and, where appropriate, should be designed and
      installed to a suitable British Standard or equivalent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liquids may be transferred by gas pressure (nitrogen or another inert gas)
      or by vacuum. Compressed air should not be used as it can create an
      explosive vapour/air mixture inside the transfer vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gas pressure should be controlled to the lowest practicable pressure
      within the system, and a means for rapid isolation of the pressure source
      and venting of the pipeline or pressure source to a safe place should be
      provided.
    </p>

    <p>Process areas should be designed and operated to minimise risks.</p>
    <p>
      Pipework systems and closed vessels are preferable to handling liquids in
      containers and open tanks, and will restrict the amount of liquid open to
      the air and reduce the risks from released vapours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liquids should not be heated above the required working temperature, as
      the amount of vapour produced increases as the temperature rises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filling lines should end as near as possible to the bottom of the vessel,
      to minimise the free fall of liquid and the generation of static
      electricity. The line should be designed to prevent any syphoning from the
      filled vessel. Fitting automatic prevention devices will reduce the
      likelihood of overfilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Automatic prevention devices should be provided to reduce the likelihood
      of overfilling vessels with flammable liquids. These devices may take the
      form of:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">an overflow</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">a pre-set meter</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">a fixed volume batch tank</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          a level detector linked to a pump or valve.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Where a high-level alarm system is fitted it should be triggered at one
      level to alert the operator to shut off the valve or pump, and at a second
      level to shut it off automatically if the operator takes no action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vent pipes should normally be provided on process plant. These will
      prevent flammable and toxic vapours released during filling and processing
      from accumulating in work areas, and direct them away from plant operators
      and possible ignition sources. Vent pipes should terminate outside
      buildings, well away from possible ignition sources, so that any vapours
      can be rapidly and safely dispersed.
