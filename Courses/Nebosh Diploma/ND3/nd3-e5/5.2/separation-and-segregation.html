      The intensity of a fire, or its rate of growth, may be increased if
      incompatible materials are stored together:

    <p>
      Non-combustible dangerous substances may become involved in a spreading
      fire causing toxic materials to be widely dispersed in the smoke plume or
      carried in the fire-fighting water, leading to harmful consequences off
      site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such situations can be avoided by ensuring that dangerous substances are
      stored separately in dedicated warehouses or suitable compartments of
      warehouses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goods inward should be assessed as part of a receipt procedure to
      determine their hazards. Decisions can then be made as to where they
      should be stored within the chemical warehouse, in accordance with site
      policies and plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incompatible materials should, where practicable, be segregated in the
      reception area, and moved to the appropriate storage area as soon as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consideration should also be given to the risk of substances degrading
      during storage. Appropriate precautions will include:
    </p>

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

    <p>
      Basic recommendations for the segregation of dangerous substances,
      according to their hazard classification under CDG, are shown in Table
      5.5. Table 5.5 does not take account of chemical incompatibilities. In
      some cases, different substances that are shown as compatible in the table
      may react together. This particularly applies to many corrosive substances
      in Class 8, which may react together to produce heat or toxic gases.
      Examples are:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          acids/hypochlorites – generate chlorine gas
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          acids/cyanides – generate hydrogen cyanide gas
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">acids/alkalis – generate heat</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          acids/sulphides – generate hydrogen sulphide.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Generally, the segregation of acids from other substances will go some way
      to preventing problems arising from incompatibilities.

      <p>Energetic substances</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->

    <p>
      Energetic substances are those substances which are capable of releasing
      energy through rapid exothermic decomposition, or polymerisation. When an
      energetic substance decomposes it can result in a fire, or an explosion.

    <p>
      Energetic substances and their decomposition products may also be toxic,
      corrosive or irritant.

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Spontaneous combustion</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->

    <p>
      Spontaneous combustion occurs when the temperature of a substance
      increases to its auto- ignition temperature, at which point the substance,
      or its products of decomposition, can inflame without a recognised
      ignition source. The temperature rise occurs, as heat is generated in
      chemical reactions with air or moisture, faster than it can be dissipated
      to the surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyrophoric substances are a special class of spontaneously combustible
      substance that ignite readily in air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most spontaneously combustible substances that have been classified by the
      UN system are in Division 4.2 (Flammable solids – spontaneously
      combustible substances). However, some may be found in other classes. They
      include:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          pyrophoric gases which are in Class 2
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          some organic peroxides from Division 5.2
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          some flammable solids from Division 4.1 may also self-heat when stored
          in large quantities for a long time
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Division 4.3 contains substances that react with water to liberate
          flammable gases. Some of those substances react to liberate sufficient
          heat to ignite the gas.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Pyrophoric substances react with air or moisture. Therefore it follows
      that measures to prevent fires or explosions are based on adequate
      containment and exclusion of air or moisture, and that fire-fighting
      measures should not use water or aqueous foams as the extinguishant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following categories provide examples of the most commonly used
      spontaneously combustible substances:

              <p>
                Finely divided metals have a large surface area available for
                reaction with air or moisture. Reactivity is affected by
                particle size, nature of the surface (such as pore size) and
                heat of reaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moisture may decrease reactivity because it aids heat
                conduction.
              </p>

              Some metals may decompose water with the evolution of heat, which
              then contributes to the temperature rise occurring due to
              autoxidation. Hydrogen can be produced and may then ignite.

                Red phosphorus is oxidised slowly in air and tends to be non-
                pyrophoric, although large bulk quantities have ignited due to
                the build-up of heat in the centre of the pile. It may also

              White phosphorus ignites in air at about 35°C and is normally
              stored under water. Some phosphorus derivatives ignite
              spontaneously in air.

                Stable natural materials can also ignite spontaneously if
                allowed to self-heat by oxidation or bacteriological action.
              </p>

                Materials liable to undergo oxidative heating include celluloid,
                coal, iron pyrites, oils, plastics, sawdust, rags, stearic acid,
                wood, soybean products and some types of wool. The mechanism of
                self-heating for many of these materials is oxidation of
                unsaturated chemical bonds.
              </p>
              Bacteriological action (for example, fermentation) may raise the
              temperature of some materials stored in bulk. Oxidation may then
              raise the temperature to the point of ignition. Moisture may
              increase the rate of reaction, and the incidence of fires in
              haystacks may be reduced by covering the stack with plastic sheets
              to keep the rain out. Examples of materials that may self-heat by
              this mechanism include straw, hay, grains, meal, sugar, and peat.
