          At around 10:30 on 3 October 1996, a tanker containing what was
          believed to be epichlorohydrin began off- loading at the Albright &
          Wilson site in Avonmouth, Bristol.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon after, a series of explosions destroyed both the storage tank and
          the road tanker and started a fire, which persisted for an hour. It
          was later discovered that the road tanker in fact contained sodium
          chlorite, which reacts explosively with epichlorohydrin. The fire
          generated a 100 m black plume of smoke containing hydrogen chloride,
          which drifted across the Severn estuary closing local motorways and
          rail services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three weeks before the delivery was due, the company received a
          quality certificate confirming the number of the tank container in
          which the epichlorohydrin would be delivered. However due to a mix-up
          by the haulier, a different numbered tank containing sodium chlorite
          was sent by mistake. No crosschecks were made against the original
          documentation, which would have highlighted that the wrong chemical
          had been delivered. By the time the haulier notified the company of
          the mistake, off-loading of the road tanker had commenced.

              <span class="ast-bold"> Epichlorohydrin</span> is a highly
              reactive chemical intermediate. The presence of both an epoxide
              ring and a chlorine atom in the molecule allows epichlorohydrin to
              readily undergo a variety of chemical reactions with many types of
              compounds.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">
              At high temperatures, epichlorohydrin can react violently and in
              some cases explosively (spontaneous polymerization) in the
              presence of certain substances such as acids, alcohols and
              alkalis.
