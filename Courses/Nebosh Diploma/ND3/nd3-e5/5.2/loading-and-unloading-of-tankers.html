        <p>
          A tank container consists of a stainless steel vessel surrounded by an
          insulation and protective layer (usually polyurethane and aluminum).
          The vessel is mounted within an ISO standard steel frame. Tank
          containers are suitable for combined (intermodal) transport by truck
          and train.
        </p>
        <p>
          A standard tank container has a manhole and at least one valve on the
          top, and a valve at the bottom, and can be loaded and unloaded from
          the top or the bottom. Loading and unloading is done by connecting
          hoses of the loading and unloading facility to the valves of the tank.

    <!--H2 Heading End-->

    <p>
      The operation of filling any road tanker or tank container with a
      dangerous substance is potentially hazardous. The loading facilities and
      transport equipment must all be correctly designed and constructed, and
      properly used and maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      All equipment, including pumps, valves and hoses, should be suitable for
      the liquids being handled and for the conditions of use, and should be
      made to an appropriate British (or equivalent) standard.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Location</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Loading/unloading bays for road tankers should be located in a safe,
      well-ventilated position at least 10 m away from occupied buildings, the
      site boundary and fixed sources of ignition. A remote controlled shut-off
      valve should be located between the storage tanks and the loading
      vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loading/unloading bay should have easy access and exit for tankers,
      preferably without reversing. The loading/unloading area and the access
      road should preferably be dedicated to tanker use only, or otherwise have
      barrier controlled access to keep other vehicles and pedestrians away
      during transfer operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Road tankers waiting to load or unload should wait in an on-site parking
      bay, away from the highway and busy internal roads, so that vehicles and
      documents can be checked with minimum interference to traffic flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bay should be level (or have a gentle gradient to assist drainage) and
      be surfaced with a material resistant to the liquids being handled.
      Drainage should be designed to minimise the surface area of any spillage,
      and lead it away from vehicles to a slop tank or interceptor.

      <p>Design of road tanker loading/unloading facility</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->

    <p>
      To minimise the risk of overfilling, tankers should normally be loaded
      using a flow meter with a trip, to stop the pump and close a shut-off
      valve automatically when a pre-set quantity has been delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      An independent high-level or overflow alarm is recommended, to provide a
      warning if the meter fails. Meters may be protected by installing flow
      control valves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before liquids are unloaded from tankers into storage tanks, particular
      attention should be paid to ensuring enough ullage (unfilled space) space
      is available in the storage tank to receive the load.
    </p>
    <p>
      High-level alarms should be provided to storage tanks to prevent
      overfilling, and self-sealing couplings on the hose connections should be
      considered to prevent spillages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Precautions should be taken against spillage due to vehicles being moved
      with the hoses still connected or arms still in place. This can be done by
      providing barriers across the tanker stance, brake interlocks on the
      vehicle or breakaway couplings on the hose connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      An emergency stop button should be installed at the loading/unloading
      point to activate a quick-action shut-off valve or pump stop control in an
      emergency. This will enable the operator/ driver to stop immediately
      loading/unloading if a problem is observed.
    </p>
    <p>Precautions against static electricity should be provided, including:</p>

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">electrically conducting hoses</li>

          elimination of splash filling, by ensuring that the fill pipe in a top
          loading operation reaches to the bottom of the tank or tanker, for
          example.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Additional protection may be provided by an interlock, to prevent
      operation of the control valve or loading pump until the earth connection
      is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safe access to equipment and safe means of escape for work above ground
      level is necessary. For top loading of vehicles, access gantries with
      stairs or ladders and protective handrails will usually be required.
      Gantries should be made of fire-resisting materials and, where necessary,
      should include means of access to the top of the tanker vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fire protection measures should be designed to minimise the risk of fire
      spread. This may be achieved by ensuring that a ready supply of water
      and/or foam is available from fixed or mobile equipment. Hand
      extinguishers should also be located at appropriate points within the
      transfer area. The loading/unloading facilities should also be fitted with
      easily accessible fire alarm activation points.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Tank connections and fittings</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Storage tank filling and emptying connections and openings for dipping and
      venting should be located at least 4 m from any source of ignition,
      building opening, trench or depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drains should be either fitted with an interceptor or routed to an
      appropriate waste collection/treatment facility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The connecting point for filling or discharge of above-ground tanks should
      be outside the bund wall, close to the tanker stand, thus keeping the
      flexible connecting hose short and helping access. The tank connections
      may need to be protected against mechanical damage by tanker vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filling above-ground tanks from road tankers can be done either using a
      vehicle pump, or a fixed pump on site. Use of a fixed pump has advantages
      as all the equipment on the vehicle can be switched off during
      off-loading, and the vehicle flexible hose and coupling is not subject to
      pump discharge pressures. Filling points should be equipped with
      non-return valves, close to the shut-off valve, to minimise any spillage
      if the shut-off valve fails to seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filling lines should be fitted with a suitable flange or coupling to
      connect with the hose of the delivery vehicle, rail car, etc., and should
      be capped when not in use. A locking cap may be advisable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dry disconnect couplings (NATO standard 3756) are the European standard
      and both ADR and RID dictate the presence of three closing devices and
      pressure retaining caps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spillage from making and breaking connections should be contained by a
      drip tray or a low sill, or be drained to a safe place. An interceptor for
      liquids not miscible with water, or other suitable collection method, may
      be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of the tank filling line should extend below the lowest normal
      operating level of the liquid, to minimise the generation of static
      electricity from splash filling. To prevent syphoning, the line should be
      self-draining. Where separate lines are used for filling and emptying, a
      liquid seal can be maintained by ending the discharge line at least 150 mm
      above the bottom of the filling line.
    </p>
    <p>
      To minimise the risk of tank leakage, it is preferable for lines to enter
      the tank at the top. This may not always be reasonably practicable,
      particularly for large vertical tanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where several different liquids are loaded/unloaded from a common
      location, the labelling of pipes and fittings is advisable to prevent
      loading to or from the wrong tank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Engineering precautions (incompatible couplings) may be required if there
      is a possibility of mixing incompatible liquids. Methods of operating
      isolation and control valves should be indicated by labels or signs where
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tank connections to underground tanks may be located in the open air above
      the tank or in a chamber below ground. The chamber may be closed by a
      watertight manhole cover or it may be raised slightly above ground level.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Each pipe connected to a tank is a potential source of a major leakage.
      Each pipeline connected to a tank should be provided with a suitable
      shut-off valve which is fire-safe and located inside the bund wall and
      close to the tank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tank filling line should also be fitted with a shut-off valve outside
      the bund wall and close to the filling connection. Any line used only for
      filling and which enters the tank at the bottom should also be provided
      with a non-return valve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other valves may be necessary depending on process conditions. They should
      be labelled to indicate their function and their method of operation,
      where necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isolating valves must be able to be closed quickly in an emergency.
      Remotely Operated Shut-Off Valves (ROSOVs) may be necessary.
    </p>
    <p>Tank drainage valves should be blanked off when not in use.</p>
    <p>
      All isolation valves should be tested periodically to ensure they are
      working correctly.
