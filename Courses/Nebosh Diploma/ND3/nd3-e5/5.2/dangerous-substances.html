    <p>
      The primary legislation applying to the control of substances that can
      cause fires and explosions in the workplace is the Dangerous Substances
      and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2002 (DSEAR).
    </p>
    <p>DSEAR implements the requirements of two European Directives:</p>

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      DSEAR requires employers to assess the risks of fires and explosions that
      may be caused by dangerous substances in the workplace. These risks must
      then be eliminated or reduced, as far as is reasonably practicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dangerous substances are substances or mixtures of substances
      (preparations) that could create risks to people’s safety, from fires and
      explosions or similar events, such as ‘thermal runaway’ from chemical
      reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dangerous substances may be liquids, gases, vapours or dusts and include:

      Many of these substances can also create health risks (for example, they
      may be toxic, corrosive or irritant). The risks from the substances
      hazardous to health in the workplace (hazardous substances) are covered
      under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations (CoSHH).

      Regulation 5 of DSEAR requires the employer to make a ‘suitable and
      sufficient’ assessment of the risks to their employees arising from a
      dangerous substance in the workplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      No new work activity involving a dangerous substance can commence unless
      an assessment has been made, and the measures required by these
      Regulations have been implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      The risk assessment must be reviewed to keep it up to date, particularly
      if there are grounds to suspect that the risk assessment is no longer
      valid, or there has been a significant change in the workplace, work
      processes, or organisation of the work.

    <p>
      The recommended risk assessment process in the guidance to the Dangerous
      Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations (DSEAR) follows the
      standard HSE ‘5 steps’ approach to risk assessment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section concentrates on the hazard identification and risk evaluation
      stages of the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazard identification (determination of the presence of dangerous
      substances) requires consideration of the following three variables:

    <p>
      Risk is the chance, high or low, that someone will be harmed by the
      hazard. The definition of ‘risk’ in DSEAR builds on the definition of
      hazard and ensures that the risks addressed are those created by the
      physical and chemical properties of substances and preparations which can
      lead to fires, explosions and similar energetic events, and the harmful
      consequences of those events.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of factors that should be taken into account when
      undertaking a dangerous substances risk assessment.&nbsp;
