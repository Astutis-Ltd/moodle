    <p>
      All parts of piping systems, including valve seals and flange gaskets,
      should be made from material compatible with the liquids being handled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plastic pipes are more vulnerable to fire and may also cause greater
      electrostatic problems. They are normally only used if there are
      particular reasons, such as product purity, and if an appropriate standard
      of construction can be achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joints and connections should be kept to a minimum and should not be
      positioned where they might leak onto electrical equipment, hot surfaces
      or other sources of ignition, or where they might prevent the use of an
      escape route.
    </p>
    <p>
      Welded joints should be used in preference to flanges, to minimise the
      risk of leakage, although small diameter piping (< 50 mm may have screwed
      joints).
    </p>
    <p>
      The likelihood and consequences of thermal expansion and
      over-pressurisation should be addressed within the system design, to
      prevent damage to pipework and dangerous releases of flammable liquids.
      Alternatively hydrostatic relief valves may be fitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pipework should be sized and routed to restrict the contents to a minimum
      (consistent with pressure-drop requirements). Pipe runs should be in the
      open air rather than inside buildings, and should be positioned or
      protected to minimise the risk of impact damage from vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pipe runs in buildings should normally be in the open, should be protected
      from localised hot surfaces or heating systems, and should not pass
      through hazard areas such as furnace or boiler rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where ducts or pipes pass through a fire-resisting structure, any gaps
      between the duct or pipe and the structure should be fire-stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Underground pipework presents difficulties with leak prevention,
      inspection and repair. If required the pipework should be laid in a
      shallow concrete or masonry-lined trench which should:

      Underground pipes require protection against corrosion (discussed in
      section on materials failure Element 6). Buried pipes should be
      polypropylene rather than metallic. Where metallic pipes are used they
      should:

      <p>Flexible hoses</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Flexible hoses should only be used where rigid piping is unsuitable, such
      as at filling connections or where vibration is a problem. Hoses should be
      made to a standard suitable for the application, and should be compatible
      with the liquids handled. They should be adequately supported by slings or
      saddles, so that the bend radius is not less than the minimum recommended
      by the manufacturer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When not in use hoses should be protected from accidental damage, extremes
      of temperature and direct sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoses should be inspected each day they are used for signs of leaks, wear
      and mechanical damage, and examined and pressure-tested at least once a
      year according to the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoses should be electrically continuous or bridged with an earthing cable
      to avoid electrostatic charging.

      Suitable valves should be provided within the pipework system to isolate
      the supply after use, during maintenance and in the event of an emergency.

    <p>
      All valves should be clearly marked and designed to achieve a rapid
      shut-down of flow. Valves may be manual or automatic, but automatic valves
      should be installed to be fail-safe.
