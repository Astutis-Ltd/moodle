    <p>
      It is good practice to inspect all dangerous goods for signs of damage or
      decomposition upon receipt. Periodic rechecking is advisable to ensure
      that there has been no corrosion or build-up of heat. The frequency of
      checking will depend on factors such as the stability of the substance,
      the need for temperature control, the likelihood of containers becoming
      damaged and the corrosiveness of the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some substances can be stored safely at normal temperatures but begin to
      decompose as the temperature increases. These should not be stored in
      areas that may overheat because of sunlight/solar gain, or heating
      equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other substances may need to be stored in a monitored,
      temperature-controlled storeroom or refrigerator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Energetic substances should not be stored with other materials where there
      is the possibility of contamination or reaction in a fire, as this may
      lower the temperature at which decomposition begins. They should also be
      kept away from substances that are likely to increase the danger in a
      fire, for example, flammable liquids and oxidisers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some substances, after prolonged storage, react with oxygen in the air to
      produce energetic substances, for example, some ethers can form peroxides
      on standing. To minimise the formation of peroxides the reagent may be
      stored in an inert atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, it is advisable to keep spontaneously combustible materials in
      a special store, away from occupied buildings. If substances are stored
      outdoors, weather protection may be required to prevent corrosion of
      containers or valves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyrophoric substances are stored in sealed containers under an inert
      atmosphere, or in some circumstances under an inert liquid. It is
      therefore important to maintain the integrity of the container, and to
      ensure that the inert atmosphere is maintained once the container has been
      opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temperature that will cause the ignition of a substance that is liable
      to self-heating depends on the quantity and dimensions of the material.
      Therefore, large amounts in hoppers or bulk containers can ignite at lower
      temperatures than small amounts of the same material in drums and sacks.
