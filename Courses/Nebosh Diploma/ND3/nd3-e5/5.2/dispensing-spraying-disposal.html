    <p>
      The need for dispensing and decanting operations should be assessed and,
      where possible, minimised by the use of enclosed transfer systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an enclosed system cannot be used, the containers should be designed to
      minimise spillage, release of vapour and the effects of fire.

    <p>
      Decanting or transfer from one container to another should normally be
      carried out away from the area where the liquid is stored, and preferably
      in the open air or in a separate, well ventilated room, so that any
      spillage and possible fire cannot involve the stored materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      When pouring manually from or into small containers, funnels, spill trays,
      drip cans or other means should be used to minimise and contain spillages.
    </p>
    <p>Containers should be bonded together or earthed.</p>

      Where flammable liquids are routinely dispensed from 210 litre drums the
      following alternative methods are recommended:

      <p>Using drum safety taps and safety vents</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Drum taps should be made of non-combustible material and be self-closing.
      Safety vents prevent excess pressure or vacuum building up inside the
      drum, and stop any ignition source from flashing back into the drum. A
      safety vent also reduces the likelihood of a drum exploding if it is
      engulfed by fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dispensing into containers with small apertures, a funnel or taps
      fitted with small- diameter hoses should be used to minimise spillage.

          Pumps ought to fit closely into the drum to minimise release of
          vapours, but they also need to be able to relieve pressure in the
          event of a fire. Flexible hoses need to be electrically conducting. If
          an electric pump is used, the electrical equipment should be
          constructed to a suitable explosion-protection standard.

      <p>Spraying</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      In the spray process, liquid is converted into a fine mist of droplets
      which is propelled towards a surface, where an evenly distributed film is
      formed. The main spray methods are:
    </p>

            <td class="ast-table__ctn__wrp__row">
              <p>
                The commonest method of spraying is the compressed air operated
                spray gun in which liquid is atomised, in either internal or
                external mix nozzles by compressed air (30-50 psi).
              </p>
              In internal-mix nozzles, liquid and compressed air are combined in
              a chamber inside the nozzle, whereas in external-mix nozzles
              liquid and compressed air are ejected through separate orifices to
              combine outside the nozzle.

            <td class="ast-table__ctn__wrp__row">
              <p>
                Airless methods atomise the liquid by forcing it through a small
                orifice (0.1-1.5 mm) at high pressure (typically in the range
                50-400 bar).
              </p>
              <p>
                The hydraulic pressure is usually produced by small piston pumps
                powered by compressed air.
              </p>
              <p>
                The amount of overspray and ricochet may be about 20% as the
                velocity of the paint droplets falls off rapidly after leaving
                the nozzle of the gun.
              </p>
              The method is limited primarily to applying viscous high-solid
              heavy-duty coatings to structural steel, because of environmental
              considerations.

                In electrostatic spraying, liquid droplets (or solid particles)
                are given an electrical charge (typically 60-150 kV) causing
                them to be attracted to an earthed conductive workpiece.
              </p>
              The charge is applied either to the liquid stream before its
              release or to atomised droplets by passing them through an
              ionising field. Up to 90% of the finish is deposited on the
              surface.

      <p>Disposal of flammable liquids</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Waste liquids will generally need to be stored and handled according to
      the same standards as the flammable liquids from which they originated.
      They will also be subject to the same legislation, unless their physical
      properties have been significantly altered by the processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waste materials collected from different processes should be stored
      separately before disposal, unless the various components are known to be
      compatible, and only after considering the eventual disposal technique to
      be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any drums used for waste materials should be sound and not contain any
      incompatible residues. If a drum is being used as a collecting station for
      waste liquids, a funnel that fits securely into the drum opening to reduce
      the possibility of spillage should be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Funnels with lids and flame arresters can be used to stop any external
      ignition from flashing back into the drum, or to prevent the drum becoming
      dangerously pressurised if it is engulfed by fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovering waste liquid by distillation or other means may be feasible,
      particularly where large amounts are involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The standard of storage should be the same as that for full containers.
      Appropriate labels should be fixed to containers to be sent off-site,
      whether nominally empty or containing waste materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consignor should provide the operator of the vehicle with the
      necessary information (in writing) about the material to be carried,
      referring to the relevant carriage and environmental legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absorbent material used to soak up spillages and contaminated rags and
      other waste materials should be kept in a lidded metal container and
      disposed of safely.
