      Hazardous area classification requires knowledge of the properties of a
      dangerous substance such as:

      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the boiling point and flash point of any flammable liquid
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          whether any flammable gas or vapour that may be evolved is lighter or
          heavier than air
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the particle size and density of dust clouds.

      <p>Size of release</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->

    <p>
      The size of any potential release of dangerous substances is in part
      related to the amount of dangerous substances present. There is multitude
      of industry guidance on the quantities of various dangerous substances
      that can be stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some potential sources of release may be so small that there is no need to
      specify a zoned area. However, in the wrong circumstances ignition of
      quite small quantities of flammable gas/vapour mixed with air can cause
      danger to anyone in the immediate vicinity. Where this is the case, as in
      a relatively confined location from which rapid escape would be difficult,
      area classification may be needed even where quite small quantities of a
      dangerous substance are present.
    </p>

      <p>Temperature and pressure</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Temperature and pressure will influence the nature and extent of any
      release of dangerous substances, and hence the extent of any subsequent
      hazardous areas. Some substances do not form explosive atmospheres unless
      they are heated, and some liquids if released under pressure will form a
      fine mist that can explode even if there is insufficient vapour.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Ventilation</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Ventilation (natural, or mechanical), can both dilute sources of release,
      and remove dangerous substances from an enclosed area. Consequently there
      is a close link between the ventilation at any given location, and the
      classification and extent of a zone around a potential source of release.

      <p>Extent of zones</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The assessment needs to identify areas within the workplace that are
      connected to places where an explosive atmosphere may occur. This will
      provide information on any areas away from the source of the hazard to
      which an explosive atmosphere may spread, for example through ducts. Such
      areas should be included in the classification system for places where
      explosive atmospheres may occur.

      <h5>Other considerations</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      All dangerous substances that may be present at the workplace should be
      considered, including waste products, residues, materials used for
      cleaning or maintenance, and any used only as a fuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The possibilities of combinations of dangerous substances reacting to form
      an ignition source, or combining to form an explosive atmosphere should be
      considered in the risk assessment.

      <p>Relationship between fires and explosions</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      In many cases where an explosive atmosphere can form, any ignition will
      cause a fire rather than an explosion, and the precautions required to
      prevent an ignition are often the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thought should be given to whether a fire could lead to an explosion, how
      fast a fire might grow, what other materials might be rapidly evolved, any
      dangers from smoke and toxic gases given off, and whether those in the
      vicinity would be able to escape.

    <div class="ast-p-and-img">

        <p>
          Flammable substances (particularly when in the form of an explosive
          atmosphere) are readily ignited.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to identify where ignition sources could be present.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many sources of ignition are easy to identify, such as naked flames,
          but others may be less obvious, such as: sparks caused by friction in
          mechanical equipment, the operation of electrical equipment, hot
          surfaces, and electrostatic discharges from an individual.

      <p>The scale of the anticipated physical effects / harm arising</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The scale of effects and the extent of harm will depend on the amount of
      heat radiated and the size of any forces created either directly or
      indirectly from an incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scale of an explosion will depend on the material, the size of the
      potential explosive atmosphere, the strength and shape of the containment,
      and whether the internal configuration or any obstructions will accelerate
      the burning rates.

      Areas within the workplace that are connected to places where an explosive
