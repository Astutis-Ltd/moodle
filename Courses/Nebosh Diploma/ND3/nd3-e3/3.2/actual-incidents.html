      The following actual incidents are offered as illustrations of the
      behaviour of structural materials in real fire situations. The incidents
      themselves are not specified on the syllabus and do not need to be studied
      for exam purposes. They can however be used to illustrate answers to
      questions regarding the behaviour of structural materials in a fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incidents are summarised in the table below and outlined in more
      detail further down the page.

    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Summit Tunnel fire, 1984</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The fire occurred at 05:50 on 20 December 1984 when a goods train carrying
      more than 220 000 gallons (one million litres) of four-star petrol in
      thirteen tankers was derailed one-third of the way through the railway
      tunnel when an axle bearing (journal bearing) failed on the fourth tanker
      knocking the following tankers off the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the derailed tankers fell on its side and began to leak petrol into
      the tunnel. Vapour from the leaking petrol was probably ignited by a hot
      axle box.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 09:40 the pressure in one of the heated tankers rose high enough to
      open its pressure relief valves. The vented vapour caught fire and blew
      flames onto the tunnel wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the walls warmed up and the air temperature in the tunnel rose, all 10
      tankers discharged petrol vapour from their pressure relief valves. Two
      tankers melted (at approximately 1530°C) and discharged their remaining
      loads as floods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many bricks in the tunnel wall melted in the flames, those which
      experienced the hottest temperatures vitrified and ran like molten glass.
      Others suffered surface vitrification or surface spalling but remained in
      situ. In other places the mortar failed and spalled and bricks fell out of
      the tunnel lining.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many bricks were scorched but serviceable. The bricks generally
      demonstrated very good fire resistant characteristics for long exposure to
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fuel supply to the fire was so rich that there was insufficient oxygen
      inside the tunnel with which to burn. The resulting superheated, fuel-rich
      gases were ejected from vent shafts 8 and 9 bursting into flame as soon as
      they encountered air outside the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pillars of flame approximately 45 metres high rose from the shaft outlets
      on the hillside above. Hot projectiles made from molten tunnel lining were
      thrown out over the hillside, setting much of the vegetation on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire brigades gained control of the situation by forcing foam into the
      ventilation shafts away from the fire starving the fire of oxygen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire brigades continued to fight the fire for a further two days,
      stopping at 18:30 on Christmas Eve. Fire crews remained at the site until
      7 January 1985.
