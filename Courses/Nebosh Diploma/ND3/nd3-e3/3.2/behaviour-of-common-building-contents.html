    <p>Furniture and fittings can have a major effect on fire spread by:</p>

      In some buildings statutory controls will be in place through licensing
      conditions for public entertainment, etc.
    </p>
    <p>The following advice is sensible for all workplaces.</p>

    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Floor coverings</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Some floor coverings may produce large volumes of heat and smoke when
      involved in fire, although flames may only spread slowly across the
      surface. If new floor coverings are installed, they should comply with BS
      5287:1988 – Specification for assessment and labelling of textile floor
      coverings tested to BS 4790.

      <p>Hanging curtains, blinds, drapes, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      All curtains or drapes should be non-combustible, or inherently flame
      retardant, or flame retardant treated to meet the performance requirements
      of BS 5867-2:2008 – Specification for fabrics for curtains and drapes –
      Flammability requirements.

      <p>Decorations</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Fabric, foliage or decorations should be constructed from materials which
      have passed the BS 5867-2 Type B test, or which have been treated to
      render them fire retardant to the same standard. Plastic foliage or
      decorations of any type should be avoided.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Upholstered furniture should comply with the performance requirements for
      medium hazard in BS 7176:2007+A1:2011 – Specification for resistance to
      ignition of upholstered furniture for non-domestic seating by testing
      composites and should be resistant to the ignition source as determined by
      the following standards:

      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Upholstered furniture should comply with the performance requirements for
      medium hazard in British Standard 7176:1995 and should be resistant to the
      ignition source: smouldering cigarette of BS EN 1021-1:1994, ignition
      source: match flame equivalent of BS EN 1021-2:1994, and ignition source 5
      in section 4 of BS 5852:1990.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filling materials for use in furnishings should be restricted to
      combustion modified foam or other materials having at least the same
      standard of fire performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furniture should be maintained free from tears, rips, etc. which would
      result in the filling being exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fire engineering literature the quantity of combustibles within an
      enclosure is termed the ‘fire load’.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fire load density refers to the quantity of fuel per unit area. It is
      normally expressed in terms of MJ/m2 or kg/m2 of wood equivalent. The fire
      load should consist of all combustible building contents and the relevant
      combustible parts of the construction, including linings and finishings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fire load densities may be determined from a fire load classification of
      occupancies and / or specific fire load surveys and calculations.
