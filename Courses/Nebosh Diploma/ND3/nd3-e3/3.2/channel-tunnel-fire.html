    <p>
      On 11 September 2008, Eurotunnel freight shuttle 7412 departed from
      Folkestone at 15:36 carrying twenty-five lorries and two vans. At about
      15:54 a fire was detected on board the train, causing the train to stop at
      15:59 near marker PK 49 in the last third of the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial cause of the fire was suspected to be a road vehicle catching
      fire as a result of an electrical fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both locomotives and the amenity coach suffered damage due to the high
      temperatures and smoke to which they were exposed. The North Tunnel, in
      which the shuttle was travelling, suffered considerable damage and could
      not be reopened to traffic until February 2009.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blaze lasted over 16 hours reaching temperatures of up to 1000oC
      causing significant damage. The tunnel lining was destroyed over a length
      of 750 metres in Running Tunnel North (RTN), with the greatest damage over
      a length of 16 metres between PK 48.417 and PK 48.433 (area of carrier
      wagon 24) and over a length of 284 metres between PK 48.417 and PK 48.701.
      The apparent depth of spalling varied, but in certain cases it extended to
      the whole depth of the concrete lining, i.e. approximately 40cm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key consideration for this part of the course is the explosive
      spalling behaviour of High Strength Concrete (HSC) in high temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      HSC has a much higher susceptibility to explosive spalling than
      normal-strength concrete. This may be due to the following reasons:

          HSC has a lower permeability and retains high moisture content inside

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Dense cement paste prevents heated moisture from escaping at elevated
          temperatures, resulting in a high pore pressure
        </li>

          HSC is normally subjected to higher compressive stresses than lower
          strength concrete.
