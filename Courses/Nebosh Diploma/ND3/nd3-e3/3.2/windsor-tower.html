    <p>
      The Windsor Tower (Torre Windsor or Edificio Windsor) was a 32 storey (106
      metre tall) concrete building with a reinforced normal strength concrete
      central core supporting the first sixteen storeys. The building featured
      two heavily reinforced concrete transfer structures (technical floors)
      between floors 2 and 3, and floors 16 and 17. Floors were 280 mm deep
      waffle slabs supported by the structure’s central concrete core,
      reinforced concrete pillars and unprotected steel beams and perimeter
      steel columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      NB: The Spanish building codes at the time of construction (1975-79) did
      not require structural steelwork to be fire protected.

    <p>
      The building utilised an ‘open plan’ floor design meaning that the fire
      compartmentation could only be floor-by-floor (about 40 x 25m).
    </p>
    <p>
      The building was unoccupied at the time of the fire and was in the midst
      of a three year refurbishment programme to include the provision of:

      Fire protection had been largely completed below the 17th floor. However,
      sections of the 9th and 15th floors had not been completed and extensive
      fire stopping was still required between the cladding and floor slabs and
      to numerous voids, and fire doors had not been installed to the vertical
      shafts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 12 February 2005 a fire started at the 21st floor, spreading to all
      floors above the 2nd floor. The fire lasted for 18 to 20 hours and
      completely gutted the tower. The cause of the fire was attributed to an
      electrical short circuit, although apparently there were signs of arson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the height of the structure and the extent of the blaze,
      firefighters could only contain the fire and protect neighbouring
      buildings. The fire burned for 26 hours, leaving the structure completely
      burnt-out above the 5th floor. The steel-glass facade was completely
      destroyed, exposing the concrete perimeter columns. A large portion of the
      floor slabs above the 17th floor progressively collapsed during the fire
      when the unprotected steel perimeter columns on the upper levels buckled
      and collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The building remained standing despite the intensity of the fire, and this
      is attributed the excellent passive fire resistance of the tower’s
      concrete columns and core, and the massive transfer structure of the upper
      technical (17th) floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire protected perimeter columns below the 17th floor survived, except
      for the unprotected columns at the 9th and 15th floors which all buckled,
      but did not contribute to any structural collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rapid fire growth and fire spread to almost all floors was attributed
      to:

    <p>
      The whole building was beyond repair and had to be demolished. The
      estimated property loss was €72 million before the renovation.
