                Concrete consists of aggregates, cement and water mixed to form
                a mouldable material which sets hard with high compressive
                strength and durability. It is non-combustible with a slow rate
                of heat transfer and can achieve fire rating requirements of 1

                Concrete (LWC), depending on the density of the aggregates used.
                High Strength Concrete (HSC) uses a low water / cement ratio
                through the addition of fly ash, slag or superplasticisers, or
                additives such as silica fume to enhance its strength.

                aggregates expand due to temperature rise. For normal weight
