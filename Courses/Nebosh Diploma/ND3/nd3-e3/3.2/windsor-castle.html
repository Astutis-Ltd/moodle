    <p>
      The fire began in The Queen’s Private Chapel at 11:33 on Friday 20
      November 1992, when a spotlight ignited a curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire spread rapidly, due to lack of fire stopping in cavities and roof
      voids, damaging more than 100 rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The restoration costs were more than £36.5 million and much effort was put
      into returning damaged rooms to their original condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Structural examinations of fire damaged oak roof timbers revealed that
      beneath the charring, many of the oak trusses had sufficient residual
      sectional properties and strength to make restoration feasible.
    </p>
    <p>
      As oak is a relatively dense timber it chars at a slow rate. The gradual
      development of a surface layer of charcoal protects the central core of
      structurally sound timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rate of combustion of timber structural elements in fire depends upon:

    <p>
      Sharp corners, coarse surfaces and fissures (cracks or splits) enlarge the
      surface-to-volume ratio, and exacerbate the effects of fire.
