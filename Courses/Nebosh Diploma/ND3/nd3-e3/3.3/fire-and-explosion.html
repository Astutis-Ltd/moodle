    <p>
      The prevention of fires and explosions relies on systems to ensure that
      the sides of the fire triangle (fuel / oxygen / ignition source) cannot
      come together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fire prevention strategies are supported by measures to protect people,
      the building, and its contents. Approaches to fire and explosion
      protection include both active and passive measures.

          Passive measures are those that are designed into the physical
          structure of the building, such as load bearing components,
          compartmentation, fire resistant materials, etc. (Note: fire
          resistance is discussed in section 2 of this element).

    <p>
      Compartmentation is the division of a building into fire-resisting
      compartments (a fire compartment may comprise one or more rooms and may
      encompass more than one storey).
    </p>
    <p>
      A fire-resisting compartment is separated from adjacent areas by
      fire-resisting elements of construction and is designed to contain a fire
      for a predetermined duration to limit the spread of fire and smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The compartment provides time for occupants to escape or take refuge by
      containing a fire until it can be extinguished. It also limits the extent
      of fire damage, aiding recovery and business continuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fire compartment is only as good as its weakest link. To be effective,
      the enclosing boundaries (i.e. walls, floors and ceilings) must be able to
      resist the spread of fire. This requires that:

      <p>Fire-resisting doors</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->

    <p>
      Fire-resisting doors are necessary in any doorway located in a
      fire-resisting compartment. An effective fire-resisting door will hold
      back fire and smoke, preventing escape routes becoming unusable, and
      preventing the fire spreading from one area to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      All fire-resisting doors are rated by their performance when tested to an
      appropriate British or European standard. The level of protection provided
      by the door is measured, primarily by determining the time taken for a
      fire to breach the integrity of the door assembly, together with its
      resistance to the passage of hot gases and flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal categories are E30 (FD30S) or E60 (FD60S) providing 30 and
      60 minutes protection respectively. Fire doors are available providing
      between 20 and 120 minutes of protection
    </p>
    <p>
      Timber doors typically require a gap of 2-4mm between the door leaf and
      the frame to ensure that the door closes flush into its frame when smoke
      seals are fitted. For fire-resisting purposes the gap is normally
      protected by installing an intumescent seal, in either the door or,
      preferably, the frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intumescent seal expands in the early stages of a fire and enhances
      the protection given by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glazing units, hinges and door furniture must provide the same level of
      protection as the door. The complete door and frame should be tested as a
      set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fire-resisting doors should be fitted with an appropriately controlled
      self-closing device that will effectively close the door from any angle.
    </p>
    <p>
      On escape routes that are used regularly by significant numbers of people
      or by people with impaired mobility, an automatic door hold-open / release
      device may be more appropriate than self-closer. These use an
      electromagnetic device to hold open self-closing fire doors during normal
      use and releasing the door in the event of a fire alarm, allowing the
      self-closing mechanism to close the door.
