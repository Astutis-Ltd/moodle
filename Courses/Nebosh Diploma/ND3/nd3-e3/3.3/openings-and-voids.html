      As part of the fire risk assessment process it is essential that the
      construction and layout of the building are evaluated by a simple
      inspection to identify any easy paths through which smoke and fire may
      spread and consider what controls may be necessary. In general, older
      buildings will have more void areas, possibly hidden from view, which will
      allow smoke and fire to spread away from its source.
