    <p>
      In general, flammable materials should be stored in secure compounds in
      the open air, away from ignition sources, vulnerable buildings and the
      site perimeter. Incompatible materials, such as flammables and oxidisers,
      should be stored separately. This topic is discussed in more detail in
      Element 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the minimum amount of flammable liquid needed to carry out work
      should be stored in workrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plastic containers of highly flammable liquids will melt in a fire,
      spilling their contents and fuelling rapid fire growth.
    </p>
    <p>The risk is reduced by:</p>

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">keeping quantities to a minimum</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          proper arrangements for storage – fire resistant containers and
          cabinet
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          suitable arrangements for the disposal of contaminated materials.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      No more than 50 litres of Highly Flammable Liquids (HFL) should be stored
      in a workroom and then only in a suitably located, fire-resisting cabinet
      or bin that will contain any leaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quantities greater than 50 litres should be stored in a dedicated store,
      and containers which are nominally empty or are not currently needed
      should be returned to that store.
    </p>
    <p>
      There should be no potential ignition sources in areas where flammable
      liquids are used or stored, and flammable concentrations of vapours may be
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any electrical equipment used in these areas, including fire alarm and
      emergency lighting systems, needs to be suitable for use in flammable
      atmospheres.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: HSE advice on safe working with HFLs uses the acronym VICES as an
      aide-memoire for basic precautions – see Table 3.9.
