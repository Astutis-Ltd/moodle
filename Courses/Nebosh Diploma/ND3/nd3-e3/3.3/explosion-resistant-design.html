      Containers and connections can theoretically be designed to withstand the
      maximum explosion pressure that may be generated. However, because of cost
      considerations this is normally restricted to new and small pieces of
      plant.

    <p>
      A simple and common method of protecting process plant against the
      consequences of an internal dust explosion is to provide one or more
      deliberate points of weakness, called explosion relief vents.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they are of suitable size and in the right place, they will safely vent
      an explosion within the plant. The intention is to prevent injuries to
      people nearby by avoiding uncontrolled failure of equipment.

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Explosion panels are designed to burst at a precisely defined bursting
      pressure. They have low inertia and provide full venting in around ten
      milliseconds. They are leak tight and have no mechanical parts, so are
      maintenance free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Explosion relief from buildings – HSE’s traditional advice for buildings
      storing flammable liquids has been to ask for a lightweight roof, which
      will act as explosion relief if a vapour cloud ignited within the
      building.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      A bursting disc is also an ‘engineered weak spot’ within a pressurised
      system which can be made to burst at a pre-determined pressure and
      temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a non-re-closing, one time device used to protect a system from
      overpressure damage or imploding, due to excessive positive or vacuum
      (negative) pressures in liquid or gaseous systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bursting discs are a low cost solution with a range of benefits over other
      relief systems. They are leak tight, reliable and maintenance free, and
      provide an instantaneous response to over pressure.
