    <p>
      Explosion suppression systems allow the control of a developing explosion
      by the rapid injection of a suitable suppressing medium into the flame
      front. They have been developed into reliable systems over years of
      testing and operating experience. They are classed as autonomous
      protective systems and need certification and appropriate marking under
      the Equipment and Protective Systems Intended for Use in Potentially
      Explosive Atmospheres (EPS) Regulations 1996.

    <p>
      Explosion suppression systems consist of a rapid-acting pressure sensor
      with a number of pressurised containers of suppressant designed for rapid
      injection into the protected vessel. The suppressant is commonly a dry
      powder, similar to those used in fire extinguishers, but in certain
      circumstances it may be water.

      Many processes use a series of interconnected units of plant, such as
      grinders, elevators, cyclones, silos and filters. Appropriate precautions
      must be taken to prevent an explosion occurring in one unit of plant from
      spreading to adjacent units causing extensive damage.
