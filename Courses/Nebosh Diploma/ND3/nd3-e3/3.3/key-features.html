      In 2013 the HSE published the second edition of “Dangerous substances and
      explosive atmospheres - the Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres
      Regulations 2002 Approved Code of Practice and guidance (L138)”.
    </p>
    <p>
      L138 incorporated, consolidated and streamlined the four previous DSEAR
      ACoPs on design, storage, control and safe maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HSE recommends that when considering hazards arising from the design
      of plant, equipment and workplaces where dangerous substances may be
      present control measures should be established to:
