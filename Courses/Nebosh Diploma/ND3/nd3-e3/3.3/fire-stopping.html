    <p>
      The term ‘fire-stopping’ relates to products used for sealing apertures
      (e.g. where services pass through compartment walls) and rectifying
      imperfections of fit or design tolerance between the fire-resisting fixed
      elements of a building to restrict the passage of fire and smoke. The
      fire-stopping products must take up any imperfections of fit at all times
      and have the same fire rating as the fixed elements of which they form a
      part and / or interface. This may be achieved by:

          any hidden voids in the construction are sealed and subdivided to

      Fire-stopping products include coated stone wool batts / boards, sealant /
      mastic coatings, mortars, preformed elastomeric seals, bags / pillows,
      pipe closures, cavity barriers, curtain wall seals, stone wool mineral
      fibre slabs and strips, and foams.
