      The combustion equation was explained earlier. The process of combustion
      can be broken down into the following stages of growth and decay:

    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Induction – </span>as heat from an external source
      is applied to a combustible material, it warms up and liberates vapour
      which mixes with air at the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Ignition</span> occurs when the material’s flash
      point is reached and the vapour / air mix is ignited. The fire is
      sustainable once the fire point has been reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Growth</span> occurs as the fire spreads through
      direct flame contact, conduction, convection and radiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the fire is established the heat output grows quickly, as air and
      fuel is in plentiful supply. Eventually most of the contents of a room
      fire will reach their autoignition temperature and will ignite
      spontaneously. This flashover engulfs the room and contents in flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Steady state –</span> after the surface materials
      are alight other solid combustibles will commence burning with a slowly
      rising temp for a long period. The length of this period depends upon the
      combustible materials available and air supply. A small total increase in
      temperature precedes the significant drop of the decay stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Decay</span> occurs as all the fuel and / or
      oxygen is used up. A smouldering phase precedes ultimate burn out. Large
      amounts of unburned carbon monoxide and solid particles of carbon are
      produced and rise upwards. These gases are superheated and potentially
      explosive however the mix is too rich to burn, as most of the available
      oxygen in the compartment is depleted. If at this stage fresh air enters
      the room a highly flammable mixture will be created and may explode
      violently. This is known as a backdraft.

      Fire is self-propagating through direct flame contact. Thermal energy is
      also transmitted by conduction, convection and radiation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Conduction</span> may occur in solids, liquids or
      gases, although it is most clearly present in solids. In conduction, heat
      energy is passed between molecules with heat flowing away from the source
      of heat towards low temperature regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ability to conduct heat (thermal conductivity) varies between
      materials. Most metals are classed as good conductors though the ability
      to conduct heat varies widely between metals.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a building fire heat energy can be conducted along unprotected
      structural steelwork and plumbing pipe work, enabling fire spread from
      compartment to compartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Convection </span>occurs only in liquids and gases
      and involves the movement of heated liquid or gas molecules from the
      source of heat to cooler areas allowing cooler molecules to replace them
      before being heated and establishing a circulation of convection currents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Convection causes the updraft in chimneys. In a building fire convection
      currents convey hot gases upwards through stairwells and open lift shafts
      spreading the fire to the upper levels. As the hot gases escape from the
      upper levels, cool air enters at low level to replace them. This helps to
      maintain the burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heat may also be transmitted by radiation which does not require an
      intervening medium. Heat is radiated as infra-red radiation and behaves in
      the same way as light (visible radiation) in that it travels in straight
      lines, will cast shadows, and will be transmitted through some materials
      and not others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fire may spread between buildings by radiation, unless separation
      distances are adequate.
