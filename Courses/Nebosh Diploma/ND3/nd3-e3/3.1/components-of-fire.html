      Anything that burns is fuel for a fire. The risk assessment should
      identify anything that will burn reasonably easily and could provide fuel
      for a fire, or cause it to spread to another fuel source. Some of the most
      common fuels found in workplaces are:

      <h5>Oxygen sources</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->

    <p>
      The main source of oxygen for a fire is in atmospheric air. This is
      provided in the workplace by: natural airflow through doors, windows and
      other openings, or mechanical air conditioning systems and air handling
      systems, or a combination of both.
    </p>
    <p>Additional sources of oxygen include:</p>

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Oxygen supplies from cylinder storage and piped systems, for example,
          oxygen used in welding processes or for medical use
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Oxidising materials (for example, chemicals such as peroxides or
          fireworks / pyrotechnics) which can provide a fire with additional
          oxygen and so help it burn.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Oxidation occurs when a substance reacts with oxygen to form an oxide. In
      simple terms an oxidising agent gives up oxygen molecules to another atom
      or molecule and receives electrons in return. This chemical reaction is
      termed a redox (Reduction / oxidation) reaction, where reduction is the
      giving up of electrons and oxidation is the receiving of electrons).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the context of fire safety the key properties of oxidising agents to be
      aware of are that:

          they may be solids, liquids or gases
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          they may contribute oxygen molecules to a chemical reaction (and in a
          combustion reaction the addition of oxygen increases the chance of a
          fire or explosion)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          they may be combustible or explosive in large quantities.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Oxidisers (oxidising agents) intensify combustion, widen the flammable
      range of flammable gases and liquids, and lower the flashpoints and
      ignition temperatures of combustible materials so that they ignite more
      readily. Oxidisers can also give rise to highly exothermic reactions when
      in contact with other substances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EU Regulation on the Classification, Labelling and Packaging of
      Substances and Mixtures (CLP) categorises oxidising solids, liquids and
      gases, each with three hazard categories and associated hazard statements.
