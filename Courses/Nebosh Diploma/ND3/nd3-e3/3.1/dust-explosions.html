      A dust explosion involves the rapid combustion of dust particles that
      releases energy and usually generates gaseous reaction products. The
      reaction is much more energetic than that with the equivalent mass of the
      materials as a solid heap or pile. This is because the surface area
      exposed to the air is much larger, and if ignition occurs, the whole of
      the cloud can burn very rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a dust explosion to occur the three sides of the fire triangle must
      come together:

    <p>
      An initial or primary explosion in processing equipment, or in an area
      where fugitive dust has accumulated, may shake loose more accumulated
      dust, or damage a containment system (such as a duct, vessel, or
      collector). Consequently, if ignited, the additional dust dispersed into
      the air may cause one or more secondary explosions. These can be far more
      destructive than a primary explosion due to the increased quantity and
      concentration of dispersed combustible dust.
    </p>

    <img

    <p>
      For an explosion to occur the concentration of dust and air must be within
      the upper and lower explosive limits for the dust involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many organic materials the lower explosive limit is in the range 10 –
      50 g/m3. A dust cloud of this concentration resembles a very dense fog.
      Upper explosive limits are difficult to measure accurately, and have
      little practical importance, but are usually considered to be
      approximately 10 times the lower limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most violent explosions usually result from dust / air mixtures that
      are fuel rich. Other factors which can strongly affect the force of the
      explosion and the explosive limits include the shape and size of the dust
      particles, and the moisture content. Only weak explosions are likely where
      the mean particle size of the dust exceeds 200 microns, or the moisture
      content exceeds 16%.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risk management strategies should focus firstly on preventing a dust
      explosion (by keeping the sides of the pentagon apart), and thereafter on
      protecting people, and minimising the consequences of an explosion.
