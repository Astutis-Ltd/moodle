      A vapour cloud explosion may be confined (for example, in a tank or
      vessel) or unconfined (in the open air). The key requirements for a VCE to
      occur are:

    <p>
      An explosion can occur when a gas or vapour cloud is ignited within a
      confined volume such as a building or vessel. As the flame propagates
      through the vapour cloud it produces hot combustion products. The
      confinement prevents expansion of these combustion products and, as a
      consequence, the pressure increases. In general, this continues until the
      confining structure fails, in some cases catastrophically.

        <p class="ast-bold">Hickson and Welch, 1992</p>
        <p>
          On 21 September 1992, a jet flame erupted from a manway on the side of
          a batch still (60 Still Base). The flame cut through an office /
          control building nearby killing two employees. Three other employees
          in these offices sustained severe burns but escaped. Two later died in
          hospital. The flame also struck a much larger four-storey office
          block, shattering windows and setting rooms on fire. One person died
          from the effects of smoke inhalation.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time of the incident 60 Still Base, which was used to distil an
          organic liquid in batches, was being raked out to remove an
          accumulation of semi-solid residue or sludge, which was rich in
          dinitrotoluenes and nitrocresols.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before raking, heat was applied for about three hours to the residues
          through an internal steam coil. This started an exothermic runaway
          reaction in the residue creating a vapour cloud, confined within the
          still. A spark from a metal rake being used to remove the sludge
          ignited the vapour resulting in a deflagration and a jet flame.
