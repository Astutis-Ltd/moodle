    <p>
      Unconfined Vapour Cloud Explosions (UVCEs) are considered to be the most
      destructive explosions in the chemical process industries. Prugh’s survey
      of 29 UVCEs in the USA in the 1970s and 80s identified the property damage
      costs as between $5 million and $100 million per event, and the total loss
      of life at 140 (average 13 per year).
    </p>
    <p>UVCEs occur in the following sequence:</p>

          A large quantity of flammable vapour is suddenly released, usually as
          a consequence of a vessel rupture. (This is likely to be a minimum of
          5 tonnes for a flammable mix to occur in the open air)

    <p>
      There are two known mechanisms for generating an explosion in a relatively
      unconfined vapour cloud:

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold"> Deflagration,</span>where the flame
          accelerates to high speed, which requires a mechanism for generating
          the flame acceleration (turbulence)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold"> Detonation </span>which, if sustained, can be
          much more damaging. Detonation may arise from the coalescence of a
          strong shock wave and a fast-moving chemically reacting front, which
          together can propagate faster than the speed of sound and produce
          over-pressures at the wave front in excess of 10 bar.

        <p>
          It is estimated that a pancake shaped vapour cloud covering an area of
          around 120 000 m2 with an average height of around 2 m formed (volume
          of 240 000 m3), and evidence suggested that the ignition source was in
          the emergency pump house.
        </p>
        <p>
          High levels of overpressure (>200 kPa) were seen in all areas within
          the cloud, irrespective of the nature of the terrain and amount of
          congestion. The maximum overpressure was probably much higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the overpressure diminished rapidly with distance away from
          the edge of the cloud and evidence suggests overpressures in the
          region of 5-10 kPa within 150 m. Another distinctive feature was the
          direction of net impulse (directional damage) which, within the cloud,
          acted in the direction opposite to the direction of the explosion
          propagation, whereas outside the cloud, acted in the direction of the
          explosion propagation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deflagration and detonation explosion mechanisms were assessed for
          their consistency with the observed explosion characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deflagration was found to be inconsistent with the significant
          near-field damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Detailed modelling of the area surrounding the emergency pump house
          supported the proposition that the trees and undergrowth along Three
          Cherry Trees Lane caused flame acceleration to a velocity of several
          hundred m/s, a speed at which a transition to detonation was
          considered possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Detonating vapour clouds are known to generate high overpressures, and
          modelling confirmed the direction of the net impulse both within and
          outside the cloud, and the rapid decline in overpressure with distance
          from the edge of the cloud as consistent with a detonation.
          (Detonating VCEs are also referred to as percussive VCEs).

        <p class="ast-bold">Flixborough, 1974</p>
        <p>
          Nypro UK Ltd operated a Nylon 66 plant at Flixborough, using
          conventional low temperature, liquid, catalytic oxidation of
          cyclohexane to cyclohexanone, which was further processed to
          caprolactam, the Nylon 66 monomer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conversion process was relatively inefficient resulting in a
          continuous circulation of some 200 tons of C6 through 6 cascade
          reactors of approximately 25 tons in a stepped sequential arrangement.
        </p>
        <p>
          On 1 June 1974 the plant loop was fully charged with C6 being warmed
          up to process temperature (160°C) and pressure (120 psi).
        </p>
        <p>
          The failure of the dog-leg pipe lead to two offset, opposed 28” jets
          of some 200 tons of 2 phase, flashing superheated cyclohexane.
          Modelling suggested that a highly turbulent vapour cloud with some
          10-20 tons of hydrocarbons in the flammable range was released over
          the site, and the nearby hydrogen reformer was identified as a
          credible ignition source.
        </p>
        <p>
          The explosion killed 28 people and injured 36 others on site,
          devastated the site and caused widespread property damage to the
          surrounding area.
