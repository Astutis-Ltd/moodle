    <p>
      At 19:15 on 7 February 2008, a sugar dust explosion at the Imperial Sugar
      Company sugar manufacturing facility in Port Wentworth, Georgia killed 14
      people and injured 36 others. The subsequent fires burnt for a week
      destroying the plant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months later the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
      cited Imperial Sugar for 108 ‘willful violations’ related to combustible
      dust at the Port Wentworth site and a similar plant in Gramercy. The
      company agreed to pay $4 million in penalties for violations at Port
      Wentworth and $2 million for violations in Gramercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary explosion occurred in the enclosed steel conveyor belt under
      the granulated sugar storage silos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massive secondary dust explosions immediately propagated throughout the
      site affecting the granulated and powdered sugar packing buildings, the
      bulk sugar loading buildings, and parts of the raw sugar refinery.
    </p>

    <p>
      Three-inch thick concrete floors heaved and buckled from the explosive
      force of the secondary dust explosions, and a wooden plank roof on the
      palletiser building was shattered and blown into the bulk sugar railcar
      loading area. Escape attempts were impeded by smoke, debris, collapsed
      walls and buckled floors. The fire sprinkler system failed because the
      explosions ruptured the water pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intense fireballs advanced through the entire north and south packing and
      palletizer buildings as sugar dust, shaken loose from overhead surfaces,
      ignited. Violent fireballs advanced through enclosed screw conveyors and
      ignited fires in the refinery and bulk sugar building, hundreds of feet
      from the packing buildings where the incident had begun.
