    <p>
      An explosion is a rapid expansion of gases resulting in a rapidly moving
      pressure or shock wave. The expansion can be mechanical (by means of a
      sudden rupture of a pressurised vessel) or it can be the result of a rapid
      chemical reaction (such as combustion). Explosion damage is caused by the
      pressure or shock wave.
    </p>
    <p>The various types of explosion are described below:</p>

          <span class="ast-bold"> Unconfined explosion:</span> Unconfined
          explosions occur in the open. This type of explosion is usually the
          result of a flammable gas release. The gas is dispersed and mixed with
          air until it comes in contact with an ignition source. Unconfined
          explosions are rarer than confined explosions because the explosive
          material is generally diluted below the Lower Flammable Limit (LFL) by
          wind dispersion. These explosions are destructive because large
          quantities of gas and large areas are frequently involved

            Boiling-Liquid Expanding-Vapour Explosion (BLEVE):</span
          >
          A BLEVE occurs if a vessel that contains a liquid at a temperature
          above its atmospheric pressure boiling point ruptures. The subsequent
          BLEVE is the explosive vapourisation of a large fraction of the vessel
          contents, possibly followed by combustion or explosion of the
          vapourised cloud if it is combustible. BLEVEs occur when an external
          fire heats the contents of a tank of volatile material. As the tank
          contents heat, the vapour pressure of the liquid within the tank
          increases and the tankâ€™s structural integrity is reduced because of
          the heating. If the tank ruptures, the hot liquid volatilises
          explosively

          <span class="ast-bold"> Dust explosion: </span>This explosion results
          from the rapid combustion of fine solid particles. Many solid
          materials (including common metals such as iron and aluminium) become
          flammable when reduced to a fine powder.
