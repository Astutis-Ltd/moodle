    <p><span class="ast-bold"> Flash Point (FP):</span> is defined as:</p>

      <p>
        … the lowest temperature, corrected to a pressure of 101.325 kPa
        (atmospheric pressure at sea level), at which a liquid evolves vapours,
        under the conditions defined in the test method, in such an amount that
        a flammable vapour and air mixture is produced in the test vessel.

      There are numerous approved test methods for determining flashpoints.
      Measurements may be made in equilibrium or non-equilibrium, and the
      apparatus may be closed cup or open cup. The most extensively used
      apparatus are: the Abel closed cup, the Pensky-Martens closed cup, the Tag
      open and closed cups, the Setaflash apparatus, and the Cleveland open cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">
        Closed cup flashpoints are normally several degrees lower than those
        determined by open cup methods, as with open cup
      </span>
      tests the vapour is slightly less concentrated at a given temperature due
      to vapour losses to the surrounding atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The test methods are used to determine the ability of a substance or
      preparation to evolve a flammable vapour and air mixture where the
      introduction or presence of an ignition source would cause a flash. The
      flashpoint determines the flammability hazard classification of a
      substance (see Table 2.1).
    </p>
    <p>The key points to note about the flash point are:</p>

      <span class="ast-bold"> Fire point:</span> The fire point is the lowest
      temperature at which a vapour above a liquid will continue to burn once
      ignited. The fire point temperature is higher than the flash point.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Auto-Ignition Temperature (AIT):</span> The
      autoignition temperature of a liquid, gas or vapour is the temperature at
      which the substance will ignite without any external source of ignition
      energy. The exact temperature value determined depends on the laboratory
      test conditions and apparatus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Vapour density:</span> The density of a gas or
      vapour is the ratio of the vapour’s mass divided by its volume, expressed
      in mg / m3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Relative density:</span> The ratio of the density
      of a substance to the density of a standard substance under specified
      conditions. For liquids the comparator is water at 4°C, and for gases and
      vapours the comparator is air. Relative density can therefore be
      considered to be the measure of the density of a gas or vapour relative to
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is calculated by dividing the molecular weight of the gas by that of
      air (approximately 28.90). Note: Air is approximately 21% Oxygen, 78%
      Nitrogen, 1% other gases – the molecular weight of Oxygen (O2) is 32 and
      Nitrogen (N2) is 28.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Flammability limits:</span> Vapour and air
      mixtures will ignite and burn only over a well-specified range of
      compositions. The mixture will not burn when the composition is lower than
      the Lower Flammable Limit (LFL), the mixture is too lean for combustion.
      The mixture is also not combustible when the composition is too rich, that
      is, when it is above the Upper Flammable Limit (UFL).
    </p>
    <p>
      A mixture is flammable only when the composition is between the LFL and
      the UFL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) and Upper Explosive Limit (UEL) are used
      interchangeably with LFL and UFL.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the lower and upper flammability limits of toluene are
      approximately 1.3% and 7% respectively.

          If the concentration of toluene vapour in air is less than 1.3% then
          combustion will not occur as the mixture of flammable vapour in air is

          If the concentration of toluene vapour in air is greater than about 7%

      <span class="ast-bold">Stoichiometry: </span> The branch of chemistry and
      chemical engineering that deals with the quantities of substances that
      enter into, and are produced by, chemical reactions. Stoichiometry
      provides the quantitative relationship between reactants and products in a
      chemical reaction.
