    <p>
      The <span class="ast-italic">Working Time Regulations (1998)</span> (as
      amended) implement the European Working Time Directive into GB law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Regulations impose specific requirements on employers with regard to
      the number of hours worked and how these hours are scheduled. Compliance
      with the Regulations may not be sufficient to adequately control fatigue
      risks as some work patterns could be compliant but still be fatiguing and
      hence increase the risk of fatigue-related error, incidents, accidents and
      ill-health.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general terms the regulations limit the maximum weekly working time to
      48 hours over any seven-day period, typically averaged over 17 weeks. For
      young people under 18the limits are generally 8 hours a day or 40 hours a
      week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drivers of goods vehicles or passenger-carrying vehicles must follow
      specific rules on hours of driving and appropriate rest breaks.
    </p>
    <p>There are 3 sets of rules that could apply to a particular journey:</p>
