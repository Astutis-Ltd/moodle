          designed in such a way that the movement of the control device is

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          located outside the danger zones, except where necessary for certain
          control devices such as an emergency stop or a teach pendant
        </li>

          positioned in such a way that their operation cannot cause additional

          designed or protected in such a way that the desired effect, where a

          made in such a way as to withstand foreseeable forces. particular

    <p>
      Where a control device is designed and constructed to perform several
      different actions, namely where there is no one-to-one correspondence, the
      action to be performed must be clearly displayed and subject to
      confirmation, where necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Control devices must be arranged so that their layout, travel and
      resistance to operation are compatible with the action to be performed,
      taking account of ergonomic principles.
    </p>

    <!--H2 Heading Start-->

      <h5>Reducing the need for access</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->

    <p>
      The need for access for operators and maintainers should, where possible,
      be designed out before manufacture by automation or remote systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Access for maintenance activities should be achievable without exposure to
      risk. For example, lubrication points should be positioned so that they
      can be accessed safely, even while the machine is in motion, or adjustment
      points should be positioned so that they can be used without opening
      guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Automated stock feed and product retrieval and remote operating controls
      are all useful means of keeping the operator away from the danger zone.
