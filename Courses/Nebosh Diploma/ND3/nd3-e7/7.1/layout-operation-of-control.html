      Effective work equipment controls should be designed to be accessible,

      deal with controls and control systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      The requirements for provision of controls only apply ‘where appropriate’,
      and should be determined by risk assessment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start, stop, and emergency stop controls are not generally appropriate
      where work equipment has no moving parts or where the risk of injury is
      negligible.
    </p>

          Controls should be located in a safe position and it should be easy to
          identify and understand what effect a particular control has, and

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Stop controls should bring the equipment to a safe condition in a safe

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Emergency stop controls should be provided at control points and other
          appropriate locations to enable action to be taken quickly. They
          should be easily reached and actuated. They should bring work
          equipment to a rapid but controlled halt so as not to create any
          additional hazards and should not be used as functional stops during
          normal operation.

    <p>
      Failure of any part of a control system, or its power supply, should lead
      to a ‘fail-safe’ condition (minimised failure to danger). This should not
      impede the operation of the ‘stop’ or ‘emergency stop’ controls.
    </p>
    <p>Note: Control systems are discussed in more detail in Element 8.</p>
