      Regulation 4 (1) of the
      <span class="ast-italic">
        Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 </span
      >(PUWER) requires every employer (and self-employed person) to ensure that
      work equipment provided for use at work is so constructed or adapted as to
      be suitable for the purpose for which it is used or provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Work equipment </span>means any machinery,
      appliance, apparatus, tool or installation for use at work (whether
      exclusively or not). The scope of ‘work equipment’ is extremely wide. It
      covers almost any equipment used at work, including:

      Regulation 4(2) of PUWER requires the employer to have regard when
      selecting work equipment to the working conditions and to the risks to the
      health and safety of persons which exist in the premises or undertaking in
      which that work equipment is to be used, and any additional risk posed by
      the use of that work equipment.
