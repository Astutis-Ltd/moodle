      Equipment must be suitable, by design, construction or adaptation, for the
      actual work it is provided to do. This means, in practice, that when work
      equipment is provided steps should be taken to ensure that it is suitable
      for the work to be undertaken, and that it is used in accordance with the
      manufacturerâ€™s specifications and instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Care must be taken to ensure that any adaptations of work equipment do not
      compromise its suitability for its intended purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compliance with Regulation 10 should ensure the initial integrity of
      equipment in many cases. Regulation 10 aims to ensure that when work
      equipment is first provided for use in the workplace it meets certain
      essential health and safety requirements including those regarding the
      initial integrity of equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adequate initial integrity is ensured by adherence to the following
      engineering principles:

    <p>
      Suitable quality controls on manufacture and appropriate inspection and
      testing help to ensure initial integrity.
    </p>

      The continuing integrity of work equipment throughout its service life is
      ensured by:

    <p>
      Regulation 4 requires that employees must not be put at any additional
      risk (an increase in the chance of injury caused by specific conditions)
      as a result of using the work equipment in a particular location and / or
      for a particular purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employers must assess the risks associated with the location and purpose
      of use and ensure that their choice of work equipment does not pose any
      added risk to their employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Work equipment may only be used for tasks that it is fit for and in
      conditions for which it is suitable. So the equipment should only be used
      to carry out those tasks for which it was intended and in the conditions
      for which it was intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Electrically powered equipment is not suitable for use in wet or flammable
      atmospheres unless it has been specifically designed or modified for the
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Electrical equipment may be used if suitably protected (See Elements 4 and
      7) or alternatives such as pneumatically or hydraulically powered
      equipment may be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ensure work equipment is suitable the employer has to foresee any
      likely problems that might arise which could affect the health and safety
      of operators while they are using the equipment, and address them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The particular problem of petrol or diesel powered mobile work equipment
      and exhaust fumes was discussed in Section 7.1.
