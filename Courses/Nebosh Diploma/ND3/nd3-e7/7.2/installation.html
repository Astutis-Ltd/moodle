      Where work equipment is of a type where the safe operation is critically
      dependent on it being properly installed (or re-installed), and where
      failure to carry this out would lead to a significant risk (one which
      could foreseeably result in a major injury or worse) to the operator, or
      other worker, a suitable inspection (by a competent person) should be
      carried out before it is put into service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Re-installation includes assembling the equipment at a new site or in a
      new location, and does not normally include repositioning or moving
      equipment, particularly where there is no element of dismantling,
      reassembling and / or fixing the equipment in position, or if its location
      is transitory.

      Where work equipment is of a type where the safe operation is critically
      dependent on its condition in use and deterioration, as a consequence of
      ‘wear and tear’ or the effects of damp or corrosive atmospheres, for
      example, would lead to a significant risk to the operator or other worker,
      periodic suitable inspections should be arranged.
