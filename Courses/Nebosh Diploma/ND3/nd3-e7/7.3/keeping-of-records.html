      Records retained should assist the competent person in the examination
      under the written scheme, the purpose being to assess whether the system
      is safe for continued use and / or if any planned repairs or modifications
      can be carried out safely.

      The user / owner should keep the following documents readily available:

      The records should be kept in such a way that it is possible to identify
      the particular system or parts of the system easily against those detailed
      in the written scheme of examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examination reports and the written scheme of examination may be kept in
      hard copy form, stored electronically or on computer disc. If a computer
      system is used to keep this information then it must be able to reproduce
      it as a written copy when necessary, for example to an inspector from the
      relevant enforcing authority. It should be protected from unauthorised
      alteration and be authenticated only by the competent person who carried
      out the examination.

      ‘Competent person’ means a competent individual person (other than an
      employee) or a competent body of persons corporate or unincorporate, and
      accordingly any reference in these Regulations to a competent person
      performing a function includes a reference to his performing it through
      his employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The level of expertise needed by the competent person to draw up the WSE
      depends on the size and complexity of the system in question. To
      illustrate the level of expertise, knowledge and experience needed in
      different circumstances, pressure systems are divided into three
      categories:
