      Sufficient examinations should be carried out to identify at an early
      stage any deterioration or malfunction that is likely to affect the safe
      operation of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different parts of the system may be examined at different intervals,
      depending on the degree of risk associated with each part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Protective devices should be examined at least at the same time and
      frequency as the plant to which they are fitted. Some protective devices
      may need to be examined at more frequent intervals. The examination should
      include checks that the devices function correctly and are properly
      calibrated or, alternatively, that they have been replaced by recently
      tested units.
    </p>
    <p>
      All relevant factors should be taken into account when deciding on the
      appropriate interval between examinations, including:

      will influence the actual frequency.
