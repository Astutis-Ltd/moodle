      <h5>Overpressure and over temperature</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Overpressure and over temperature are the most common causes of failure of
      pressure systems, especially boilers.

      <p>Over temperature</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Over temperature / overheating in boilers arises as a consequence of low
      water levels which is typically caused by inappropriately specified
      controls, a lack of testing and maintenance of controls, and inadequate
      water treatment causing scaling and localised overheating.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Overpressure</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Overpressurisation can occur if temperature controls and pressure relief
      valves are inadequate by design or fail in service as a result of lack of
      testing or inadequate maintenance. Operator error may also be a factor.
      Note: pressure vessels are usually manufactured to withstand 3 times their
      safe working pressure.

      <p>Excessive stress</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Excessive stress is stress beyond the capability of the vessel or system.
      This could arise because of poor design, because of stresses arising
      during manufacture of components or assembly of the system, the
      application of other external stresses (see below), or weakening of the
      system due to ‘wear and tear’.

      <p>Abnormal external loading</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Abnormal external loading may occur from vehicular impacts, explosions
      from other vessels, or ladders being supported by pipework.

      <p>Mechanical fatigue and shock</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The positive pressure within a pressure system causes tensile stresses in
      all directions. If pressure levels vary within a system the stresses also
      fluctuate. These cyclical fluctuations can give rise to fatigue failures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanical shock is a sudden acceleration or deceleration of an object
      typically induced by an impact. Mechanical shocks can cause brittle
      materials to fracture and ductile materials to stretch or bend.
