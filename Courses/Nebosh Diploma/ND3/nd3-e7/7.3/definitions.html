      Pipework means a pipe or system of pipes together with associated valves,
      pumps, compressors and other pressure containing components and includes a
      hose or bellows but does not include a pipeline or any protective devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pipeline means a pipe or system of pipes used for the conveyance of
      relevant fluid across the boundaries of premises, together with any
      apparatus for inducing or facilitating the flow of relevant fluid through,
      or through a part of, the pipe or system, and any valves, valve chambers,
      pumps, compressors and similar works which are annexed to, or incorporated
      in the course of, the pipe or system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Protective devices means devices designed to protect the pressure system
      against system failure and devices designed to give warning that system
      failure might occur, and include bursting discs.
