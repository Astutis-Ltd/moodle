    <p>
      Thermally induced stress is an obvious concern in steam boilers and hot
      water heating systems. Fatigue failures are caused by thermally induced
      stress cycling which in a boiler occur during every firing cycle of the
      burner (burner on / burner off).
    </p>
    <p>
      Several conditions can contribute to boiler stress and eventual cracking.
      All involve introducing excessively low temperature water or cool water at
      high flow rates into a hot boiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the term ‘shock’ suggests a sudden impact type failure this is
      rarely the case. Thermal shock occurs when a thermal gradient causes
      different parts of an object to expand by different amounts. Rapid and
      uneven expansion and contraction of a boiler’s structure can result in
      catastrophic failure.

      <h5>Creep</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Creep (a progressive plastic deformation) is observed in all material
      types. It becomes an issue with metals at temperatures >40% of their
      melting point in Kelvin (0.4Tm K).
    </p>
    <p>
      A combination of the temperature and the length of service determines
      whether or not creep must be considered as a possible mode of failure for
      a given material component.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soft metals such as tin and lead creep at room temperature while aluminium
      and its alloys creep around 250°C and steel creeps at about 450°C.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stress (force applied) giving rise to the deformation may be due to
      gravity, centrifugal force or positive pressure in a pressure system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creep can be a concern in pressure systems operating at elevated
      temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>A typical creep curve is shown in the image below.</p>

    <p>
      Creep caused the failure of the forged aluminium-copper alloy impellers in
      the jet engine for the Gloster Meteor aircraft (Britain’s first
      operational jet aircraft in World War II). The engines were operating at
      200°C (a creep inducing temperature), centrifugal forces were applied
      during the operation of the impellers and consequently the operating life
      was limited to a few hundred hours before failure. (The problem was soon
      designed out with the development of creep resistant nimonics / nickel
      alloys which are creep resistant to 650°C).
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: There is evidence of a synergistic relationship between creep and
      fatigue (i.e. their joint effect is greater than the sum of their
      individual contributions).

      <h5>Hydrogen attack</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Since around 1960, hydrogen attack, or embrittlement, has been encountered
      with increasing frequency in high-pressure, high-purity boiler systems. It
      is not encountered in the average industrial plant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurs only when a hard, dense scale is present on the tube surfaces,
      permitting hydrogen to concentrate under the deposit and permeate the
      metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hydrogen attack may develop very quickly so constant surveillance of
      condensate purity is required.
    </p>
    <p>
      When atomic hydrogen permeates the metal structure, it reacts with the
      carbon content to form methane. Because the methane molecule is too large
      to diffuse through the steel, excessive pressure develops within the metal
      structure, causing the metal to crack along the crystalline boundaries
      where methane has formed.
