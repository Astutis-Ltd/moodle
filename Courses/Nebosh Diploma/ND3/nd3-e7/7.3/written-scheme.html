    <p>
      Before a pressure system is operated the user / owner must ensure that a
      written scheme of examination has been prepared and drawn up by a
      competent person, or if drawn up by someone other than a competent person,
      certified as suitable by a competent person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The level of expertise needed by the competent person depends on the size
      and complexity of the system in question. Systems are classified as minor,
      intermediate or major depending on their size, complexity and contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      For minor systems the competent person should be an incorporated engineer,
      for intermediate and major systems a chartered engineer is required.

      The pressure system must be properly maintained in good repair, so as to
      prevent danger.

      The manufacturer / supplier’s maintenance instructions should form the
      basis of the maintenance programme. The type and frequency of maintenance
      tasks (inspections, replacement of parts etc.) should be decided for all
      those parts which, through failure or malfunction, would affect the safe
      operation of the system. A suitable programme should take account of:
