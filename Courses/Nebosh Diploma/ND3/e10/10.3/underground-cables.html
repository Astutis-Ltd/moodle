      If there is a need to make dead for work to proceed safely, the
      electricity company will require at least a week’s notice, as customers
      whose supply is to be disconnected must be given at least five days’
      notice.

    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Plans or other suitable information about all buried services in the area
      should be obtained before excavation work starts, when the work is being
      planned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plans can only give an indication of the location, configuration and
      number of underground services at a particular site. They are rarely drawn
      accurately to scale, and scales can be changed during copying. Plans
      should be used as a guide to help tracing by locating devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      If plans and information are not available (during emergency work, for
      example) the work should be planned on the assumption that there are
      buried services in the area.

      <span class="ast-bold">Radio mode –</span> detects low-frequency radio
      signals, which may be picked up and re-emitted by long metallic pipes and
      cables. If radio frequency detection is used, other metallic objects may
      re-radiate the signal and results may vary appreciably according to
      locality, length of the buried cable or pipe, and distance from the
      termination and geographical orientation.

      <span class="ast-bold">Generator mode –</span> detects conductors
      radiating a signal applied by the signal generator (genny). The genny

      connection to the service, or by signal induction.

      Detecting the signal enables the service carrying it to be located, traced

      <p>(4) Safe digging practice</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Excavation work should be carried out carefully and follow recognised safe
      digging practices. Once a locating device has been used to determine
      position and route, excavation may proceed, with trial holes dug using
      suitable hand tools as necessary to confirm the position of any buried
      services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hand-held power tools and mechanical excavators should not be used too
      close to underground services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excavations should run alongside the service rather than directly over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horizontal digging is recommended for final exposure of the service, as
      hand tools can be controlled more effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once exposed, services may need to be supported, and should never be used
      as handholds or footholds for climbing out of excavations.
    </p>
    <p>
      All services should be assumed to be live until disconnected and proven
      safe at the point of work.

      Most electricity cables are coloured black, though some high voltage
      cables are red. Where ducts are used they are normally coloured black, if
      of modern plastic construction. Protection tiles made out of concrete clay
      or plastic may be placed in the ground above a cable. Where marker tapes
      are present, they are usually coloured yellow with a black legend, but the
      absence of these must not be regarded as indicating that no cables are
      present. Marker tapes or tiles should not be removed or displaced.
