          In any accident involving electricity the first priority is to isolate
          the power supply. If this is not possible the contact between the
          victim and the conductor must be broken. This must never be attempted
          with bare hands. The rescuer should wear rubber gloves or use an
          insulator, such as a long handled wooden broom, and stand on an
          insulating material, such as rubber matting or a timber pallet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the victim has been safely isolated from the supply help should
          be summoned (first aider and emergency medical response), and first
          aid should be administered. First aid would include:

    <p>
      The Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) are contractually obliged to
      provide good customer service and reduce the number of customer
      interruptions. This has led to an increase in live working.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with all live work this needs to be justified to comply with Regulation
      14 of the
      <span class="ast-italic">Electricity at Work Regulations 1989.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Live working is carried out on a variety of tasks including: tension
      insulator replacement, overhead conductor repairs, binder replacement,
      pole and cross arm changes and jumper connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Hot glove working</span>
      involves staff working within safety distance zones and actually handling
      live conductors. This enables the work to be done without taking customers
      off electricity supply, significantly reducing power outage periods
      relative to traditional shutdowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Hot stick work</span>
      involves the use of Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic (FRP) constructions,
      used (depending on the end attachment) as clamp sticks and switch sticks.
      Work is often characterised by the length of the stick. Short stick work
      involves the technician working by positioning himself on pole-climbers,
      part way up a pole or, more commonly, from an insulated bucket. Long stick
      techniques involve working from ground level.
