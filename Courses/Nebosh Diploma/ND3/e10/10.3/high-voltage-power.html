    <p>
      As mentioned in Element 8.1, high voltage is generally considered to be
      greater than 1000V (1kV) AC or 1500V DC. Typical exposure to high voltages
      will be via underground and overhead cables used for distributions and at
      sub stations (not on syllabus).
    </p>
    <p>
      The National Grid (National Grid Company plc) owns and maintains the
      high-voltage electricity transmission system in England and Wales,
      together with operating the system across Great Britain. Transmission
      involves the bulk transport of high voltage (400kV or 275kV) electricity
      from the generators to the Distribution Network Operator (DNO) companies
      for distribution and supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DNOs are responsible for the assets transporting electricity from the
      national grid supply to the consumer. Transport assets include overhead
      lines, underground cables, switches and transformers with voltages from
      132kV to 230V.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transformers are used to step down from 132kV to 33kV, then from 33kV to
      11kV. A substation will then reduce the voltage to 400V (three phase) and
      230V.
