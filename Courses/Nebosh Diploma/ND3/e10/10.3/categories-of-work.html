      Ground level barriers should be erected 6 meters away from, and parallel
      to, the overhead line to prevent any part of mobile plant approaching too
      close to the line. Additional clearance will be required for plant with
      long jibs or booms.
    </p>
    <p>
      A line of coloured plastic flags or ‘bunting’, mounted at a height of from
      3 to 6 metres above ground level immediately over the barriers, could be
      used to give plant operators an additional indication of proximity to the
      line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supports for the bunting should be sited at least 9 metres from the
      position of the nearest conductor to the barrier when projected vertically
      onto the ground. Care is necessary when erecting bunting and flags to
      avoid contact or approach near to the conductors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there will only be access on one side of the line, a barrier on this
      side only will suffice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fences, posts, oil drums, etc. should be made as visible as possible by,
      for example, being painted with red and white stripes. Alternate red and
      white plastic warning flags may be hung on or immediately above any fence
      line to improve their visibility.
    </p>

      The following precautions should be followed to provide safe passage under
      the overhead line, either along an access road or from one part of the
      work area to another:

          The width of the passageway should be restricted to the minimum needed

        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The surface of the passageway should be levelled, firmed up and well

        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The passageway should cross the route of the line at right angles

        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The passageway should be fenced to define its route, with goal posts

        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      If work beneath live overhead lines cannot be avoided, barriers, goal
      posts and warning notices should be provided. However, they will not
      prevent danger from upward movements of cranes, excavators or other
      appliances, nor will they prevent direct contact by workers where
      buildings or structures are being erected beneath the lines.
    </p>
    <p>The following additional precautions are recommended:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The safe clearance required beneath the overhead lines should be
          established
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Plant, equipment or tools that could reach beyond the safe clearance
          limit should not be taken under the line
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Cranes and excavators should be modified by the addition of suitable
          physical restraints, so that it cannot reach beyond the safe clearance
          limit
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Access for plant and materials, and the working of plant should be
          under the direct supervision of a suitable person.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      In cases where buildings or structures are to be erected under overhead
      lines (and for those occasions when work has to be done at or from an
      existing building) increased risks will arise because of the chance of
      safe clearances being reduced by the proximity of the works, and by
      provision of the required access above ground level.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such cases a horizontal barrier of timber or other insulating material,
      or an earthed steel net should be erected beneath the live conductors to
      form a roof over the construction area.
