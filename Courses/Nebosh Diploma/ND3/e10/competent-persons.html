    <p>
      Electrical work should only be undertaken by persons with sufficient
      technical knowledge or experience to prevent danger or injury, or should
      be undertaken with an appropriate level of supervision, having regard to
      the nature of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one should be placed at risk due to a lack of skills on their own part,
      or on the part of others dealing with electrical equipment.
    </p>
    <p>The scope of ‘technical knowledge or experience’ may include:</p>

          understanding of the hazards which may arise during the work and the
          corresponding precautions

    <p>
      Employees should be trained and instructed to ensure that they understand
      the safety procedures which are relevant to their work, and should work in
      accordance with those procedures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where a person’s technical knowledge or experience is not sufficient to
      ensure that they can undertake the work safely, the work should be
      conducted under supervision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supervision does not necessarily require continual attendance at the work
      site, but the level and manner of supervision should be sufficient to
      prevent danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The responsibilities of the supervisor should be clearly defined. Where
      the risks are low, verbal instructions may be adequate, but as the risk or
      complexity increases written procedures will be required.
