    <p>
      There is no universally accepted definition of what is meant by portable
      or transportable electrical equipment. HSE guidance Maintaining portable
      electrical equipment (HSG107) holds it to mean:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        Equipment that is not part of a fixed installation, but is intended to
        be connected to a fixed installation, or a generator, by means of a
        flexible cable and either a plug and socket, or a spur box, or similar
        means.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>This includes equipment that is:</p>
    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          hand-held or hand-operated while connected to the supply
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          intended to be moved while connected to the supply
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          likely to be moved while connected to the supply.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The electrical supply to the equipment is assumed to be at a voltage that
      can give a fatal electrical shock to a person, i.e. &gt;50V AC or 120V DC.
    </p>

    <p>Examples of portable equipment include:</p>
    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          tools and extension leads in the construction industry (high-risk)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          grinders and hand lamps in general manufacturing (medium-risk)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          floor cleaners and metal-bodied kettles in offices (medium-risk).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Extension leads, plugs and sockets, and cord sets that supply portable
      equipment, are classified as portable equipment because they operate in
      the same environment, and are subject to the same use as the equipment
      they serve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Portable equipment is likely to be subjected to, and more vulnerable to,
      physical damage and wear, or harsh treatment in use, than equipment which
      forms part of the fixed installation. The fixed installation is usually
      provided with a significant degree of protection against damage by the
      fabric of the building or fixed enclosure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Equipment that is held by hand or handled when switched on will present a
      greater degree of risk because, if it does develop a dangerous fault, the
      person holding it will almost certainly receive an electric shock.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: IET Guidance recognises that different inspection and maintenance
      regimes are required for different types of portable electrical equipment
      and categorises equipment as follows:
