                In general it is the responsibility of the employer or
                self-employed person to comply with the provisions of EAWR, in
                so far as they relate to matters which are within his control.
                The equivalent duty is placed on the manager of a mine and the
                operator of a quarry.
              </p>
              <p>Employees have the following duties while at work:</p>

              This means an electrical system in which all the electrical

              of electrical energy, and includes such source and such equipment.
              The term includes all the constituent parts of a system,
              (conductors and electrical equipment for example), and is not a

    <p>
      The term ‘strength and capability’ of electrical equipment refers to the
      ability of the equipment to withstand the thermal, electromagnetic and
      electro-chemical effects of the electrical currents which might be
      expected to flow through them.
    </p>
    <p>
      These currents include typical load currents, transient overloads, and
      fault currents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insulation must be effective to enable the equipment to withstand the
      applied voltage and any likely transient over-voltages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most electrical equipment is only able to withstand short-circuit currents
      safely for a short period, so additional over-current protection will be
      required.

    <p>All conductors in a system should be:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          suitably covered with insulating material and otherwise protected so
          as to prevent danger
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          suitably placed, or have other suitable precautions to prevent danger.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Suitable insulation of the conductors in an electrical system is typically
      the primary safeguard to prevent danger from electric shock. It will also
      prevent danger from fire and explosion arising from contact of conductors,
      either with each other or with earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The insulation may require protection from mechanical damage. Such
      protection would include the use of steel trunking and conduits, or the
      use of steel armoured cables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples where bare conductors are used in conjunction with suitable
      precautions are to be found in many applications, including overhead
      electric power lines and railway electrification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suitable placing of the conductors will go a considerable way towards
      preventing danger, for example, at such an overhead height that contact is
      not reasonably foreseeable, or within a secure enclosure.
