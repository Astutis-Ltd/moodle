    <p>
      Safe Systems of Work (SSW) for working on installations made dead and for
      live working were discussed earlier. As discussed in Element 5 a
      Permit-To-Work (PTW) system is a formal recorded process used to control
      work which is identified as potentially hazardous. It is also a means of
      communication between the various parties who carry out the hazardous
      work.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Electricity PTW</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      On high-voltage systems, and often on high-energy systems, a
      permit-to-work should be issued but only after the dead working procedures
      discussed earlier have been followed and a secure, locked off isolation
      has been achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      An electrical PTW is primarily a statement that a circuit or item of
      equipment is safe to work on. A permit should not be issued on equipment
      that is still live.
    </p>
    <p>
      A high voltage electrical isolation certificate is typically colour coded
      yellow, or white with a yellow edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information given in the permit should be precise, detailed and
      accurate. It should state which equipment, etc. has been made safe, the
      steps by which this safety has been achieved and exactly what work is to
      be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no circumstances should anyone be allowed to work on equipment that is
      not specified in the permit as having been made safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is found that a programme of work must be changed, no variation of
      any kind should be introduced until after the existing permit has been
      cancelled and a new one issued.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only person who has the authority to agree the change in programme and
      issue the new PTW is either the person who issued the original permit, or
      the person nominated by management to take over the responsibility, at the
      end of a shift or during absence on leave, for example.
    </p>
    <p>
      A PTW should be issued by only a designated competent person who has
      sufficient technical knowledge and / or experience and who is familiar
      with the system and equipment. The person should be authorised, in
      writing, by the employer to issue permits relating to specified equipment
      or systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before issuing the permit, this person should work out, in detail and in
      writing, what the various steps are to disconnect, isolate, prove dead,
      lock OFF and earth the equipment, post warning notices, and identify the
      equipment to be worked on and adjacent equipment which will still be live.
    </p>

    <p>The permit-to-work should state clearly:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The person the permit is addressed to, i.e. the leader of the group or
          working party, who will be present throughout the work
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The exact equipment which has been made dead and its precise location
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">The points of isolation</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">Where the conductors are earthed</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Where warning notices are posted and special safety locks fitted
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The nature of the work to be carried out
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The presence of any other source of hazard, with cross-reference to
          other relevant permits
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Further precautions to be taken during the course of the work.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      In most cases a diagram should be included on, or be attached to, the
      permit, confirming the above information and showing the zone for work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The PTW should be issued at the place where the work is being done. The
      permit issuer should explain the work and agree the accuracy and
      completeness of the details with the person doing the work before they
      both sign the permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The permit issuer should be sure that all necessary action has been taken
      to make the equipment safe. As a general rule this should be by a personal
      inspection – but this will not always be practicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appropriate arrangements should be made for countersigning where a degree
      of divided responsibility may arise, for instance between the Distribution
      Network Operator (DNO) and the duty holder at the customer’s premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The person who accepts the permit (i.e. the person who is in immediate
      charge of the operation) becomes, from that moment, responsible for
      ensuring that all the specified safety precautions are adhered to, that
      only permitted work is done and that this is confined to the area defined
      in the permit. If the permit is issued to the leader of a group, the
      leader accepts responsibility for people in the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recipient of a permit-to-work should keep it for reference while the
      work is in progress, and to prevent inadvertent cancellation and
      re-energisation of the equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the work is complete, whoever the permit clearance was issued to
      should sign it to declare that any additional earths and tools have been
      removed and people in the group have been withdrawn and instructed not to
      approach the equipment again. The person clearing the permit should also
      indicate whether or not the equipment is fit for service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The permit is then returned, preferably to the designated competent person
      who originally issued it, for cancellation before the equipment is
      re-energised.
    </p>
    <p>
      To reduce the scope for misunderstanding when work is suspended, it is
      always preferable that the original permit is cancelled and a new one is
      issued when required. The suspension of permits-to-work is not generally
      recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any PTW system should also have an additional procedure for monitoring
      (audit) to ensure that the safety rules are followed and the documents are
      completed accurately. The monitoring should preferably be carried out by
      someone with managerial responsibilities, who is not involved in the
      day-to-day issuing of permits, and should be random and on-going so that
      bad habits and inaccuracies can be identified and eliminated quickly.
