      The
      <span class="ast-italic">Electricity at Work Regulations 1989</span>
      (EAWR) require precautions to be taken against the risk of death or

      The relationship between these general duties and the more specific
      requirements is shown in the image below. Some of the key requirements are
      discussed in detail later.

      The main duties are held by the employer, though employees have duties to
      co-operate with the employer and to comply directly with requirements for
      any matters under their control.
