        <p>
          A fuse contains a piece of wire that melts easily. If a fault in an
          appliance causes too much current flow through the fuse the wire heats
          up until it melts and breaks the circuit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fuse is designed to protect the wiring and the appliance if a
          fault occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fuses operate too slowly to provide protection against electric shock,
          and are easy to replace with incorrectly rated fuses or other metal
          ‘bridges’, such as nails, screws or bolts.

    <p>
      An MCB does the same job as a fuse, but works in a different way. A
      spring-loaded push switch is held in the closed position by a
      spring-loaded soft iron bolt. An electromagnet is arranged so that it can
      pull the bolt away from the switch if the current increases beyond a set
      limit. This releases the push switch into the open position and breaks the
      circuit.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      RCD is a generic term which embraces a range of related devices. An RCD
      constantly monitors the current flowing in the live and neutral wires
      supplying a circuit or piece of equipment. Under normal circumstances, the
      current flowing in the live and neutral wires is equal. When an earth
      leakage occurs due to a fault, an imbalance occurs. The imbalance is
      detected by the RCD, which automatically cuts off the power before injury
      or damage can result.
    </p>
    <p>
      RCDs for protecting people have a rated tripping current (sensitivity) of
      not more than 30 milliamps (mA), and a non-adjustable rated operating time
      of 200 milliseconds (ms) at a test current of 30mA, and 40ms at 150mA.

    <p>
      ‘Double insulation’ covers the live conductors of electrical equipment
      with two discrete layers of insulation. Each layer would adequately
      insulate the conductor but together greatly reduces the probability of
      danger arising from insulation failure.
    </p>

    <!--Astutis Paragraph and Image Start-->
    <div class="ast-p-and-img">
      <div class="ast-p-and-img__p">
        <p>
          Double insulation eliminates the need for an earthing protective
          conductor and has been found to be useful for portable electric motor
          driven tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Double insulated equipment is labelled as Class II or double
          insulated, and marked with the double insulation symbol of a box
          within a box.
        </p>
        <p>
          The integrity of the protection depends on the layers of insulation
          remaining in sound condition, and that the equipment is properly
          constructed, used and maintained.

    <p>
      Reduced voltage systems are particularly appropriate for portable
      equipment in the following circumstances:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          highly conducting locations, such as boilers and tunnels

          high risk of mechanical damage to equipment and trailing cables
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          where the body may be damp and have large areas of contact with the
          conductor.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Keeping the supply voltage as low as is able to do the job combats risk at
      source and provides a safer solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of 110V CTE (centre tapped to earth) supply (reduced low voltage)
      is advocated in the UK for harsh environments, such as construction sites.
      The centre tap to earth ensures that in a single phase system the maximum
      voltage to earth is only 55V.
    </p>

    <p>
      SELV systems (Safety or Separated Extra Low Voltage) are separated from
      earth and have a limited voltage of 50V. SELV is typically used for
      lighting systems on construction sites. SELV would be impractical for most
      power tools, especially those with motors or requiring long cables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Battery powered tools are available with 12V, 25V and 36V DC battery
      packs. These may be considered the safest option, as in addition to the
      low voltage they are not encumbered by power cables. The trade-off is that
      the power available may not be sufficient for the job.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Isolation (isolated systems)</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The most common example of an isolated system is the circuit which
      supplies power for an electric shaver in the bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power source is an isolating transformer with an unearthed secondary
      winding. The electrical separation between the earthed core of the
      transformer and the secondary winding represents a gap in the fault loop
      which prevents the flow of a fault current.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a fault current cannot flow, the danger of electric shock is removed.
      However, if the system developed a fault which resulted in it being
      earthed, the danger would return.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Earth-free zones (earth-free non-conducting environments)</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      If the power supply is earth-referenced and work is carried out in an
      earth-free non-conducting area, dangerous potentials to earth are
      eliminated because no path exists for earth fault currents. Consequently,
      there is no danger of electric shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although this is an attractive method of protection against electric shock
      it is difficult to maintain in practice and therefore only has very
      specialised applications, such as TV repair workshops.
