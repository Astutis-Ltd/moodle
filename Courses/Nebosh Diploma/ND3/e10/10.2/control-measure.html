      As discussed in Element 5, Regulation 4 (1) of the Provision and
      <span class="ast-italic">Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998</span>
      (PUWER) requires every employer (and self-employed person) to ensure that
      work equipment provided for use at work is so constructed or adapted as to
      be suitable for the purpose for which it is used or provided.
    </p>
    <p>The suitability of work equipment is considered from three aspects:</p>

            the purpose for which it will be used.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <!--List Numbered End-->

    <p>
      As an example, electrical equipment is not suitable for use in wet or
      flammable atmospheres, unless it is specifically designed for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equipment selected should be physically capable of doing the job, and
      designed and constructed so that mechanical and electrical stresses do not
      cause the equipment to become unsafe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a damp environment, battery or air powered equipment may be more
      suitable. Alternatively, reduced voltage equipment supplied by a
      transformer with 110V output, that is Centre Tapped to Earth (CTE), as
      typically used in the construction industry, might be more appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In environments that present an explosive atmosphere (for example,
      flammable aerosols, vapours, gases or dusts) suitably rated equipment
      should be chosen (Element 4).
    </p>
    <p>
      In a conductive environment with restricted movement (such as inside a
      metal tank) additional precautions are necessary.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Precautions are required to prevent danger when a conductor (other than a
      circuit conductor) becomes charged as a result of the use of a system, or
      a system fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on the circumstances this may involve introducing precautions
      to:

        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          ensure that if a conductor does become charged, the values of voltage
          and current and the duration are such that danger will not arise.

      A range of techniques may be used individually or in combinations,
      including:

      These techniques are described in more detail over the next few pages.

    <!--H4 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Earthing the exposed metal parts of an appliance (which should not
      normally carry a current) provides a low resistance path to earth for any
      fault current. An electric current will always try to find the path of
      least resistance to earth (zero potential), and the earth wire is designed
      to provide a more efficient route than a human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many 230 / 400V power installations are designed so that an earth fault
      triggers the automatic interruption of the supply by fuses, or automatic
      circuit breakers. Such installations will require regular testing to
      ensure that the protective devices will work in the event of an earth
      fault.
