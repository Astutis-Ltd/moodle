              have an isolating gap sufficient for the voltage levels present,
              or likely to occur. Switches should be locked in the OFF position
              using a suitable ‘safety’ lock.

              warn of the danger of re- energising, and danger notices should be
              placed adjacent to the place of work indicating equipment and
              circuitry that is still live.

              Checks should be made at the point of work to prove that the parts
              to be worked on or near really are dead. The device used for
              proving dead should itself be proved immediately before and after

              To minimise the risk to workers, properly designed earthing

              An electrical permit-to-work should clearly state that the circuit
              or item of equipment is safe to work on. It should never be issued
              on equipment that is still live. The information given should be
              precise, detailed and accurate. It should state which equipment,
              etc. has been made safe, the steps by which this safety has been
              achieved, and exactly what work is to be done.
