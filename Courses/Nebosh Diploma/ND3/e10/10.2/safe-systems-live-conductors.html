      Work on or near live conductors should be the exception to the rule. Live
      working should only be permitted if:

          It is unreasonable in all the circumstances for the conductor to be
          dead. Examples might include commissioning a complex control cabinet,

          It is reasonable in all the circumstances for the person to be at work

      A system of written procedures is required whenever electrical work is to
      be carried out. The amount of detail necessary will depend on the
      circumstances, for simple work a brief policy statement (specifying always
      switching off, working dead and never working on live equipment) backed up
      by a set of simple instructions would be appropriate.

      The only effective way of management knowing that the Regulations are
      being complied with is by carrying out regular checks of the work. This is
      particularly important if the work is being done in the field, on another
      occupier’s premises or by peripatetic workers.

      Supervision should be proportionate to the danger and the competence of
      the people doing the work.

      There will be a greater need for supervision when working live as opposed
      to working dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is more than one group at work, the supervisor should ensure that
      the activities of the various groups are effectively co-ordinated.
