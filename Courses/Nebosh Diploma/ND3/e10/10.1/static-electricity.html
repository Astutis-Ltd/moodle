          Static electricity refers to the build-up of electric charge on the
          surface of objects. Static electricity is usually created when two
          different (dissimilar) materials are pulled apart or rubbed together,
          causing positive (+) charges to collect on one material and negative
          (−) charges on the other surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considerable electrification occurs when separating two good
          insulators, or a good conductor and a good insulator, such as nylon
          carpets and shoe soles.

      If these charges do not have a path to the ground, they are unable to
      move, i.e. are ‘static’. The generation of static charge is influenced by

      The main hazard of static electricity is the creation of spark that
      ignites an explosive or flammable atmosphere. The following four
      conditions would have to be met for this to be a concern:

      The most desirable method of control, which is the prevention of static
      generation, is rarely achievable in practice. Control strategies therefore
      focus on preventing a charge from building up to a hazardous level, by
      providing a means by which separated negative and positive charges may
      re-combine or flow harmlessly to earth, before sparking potentials are
      reached.
    </p>
    <p>Control strategies include:</p>

          <span class="ast-bold"
            >Equipotential bonding and earthing of metal components</span
          >
          is generally the single most effective means of control. Equipotential
          bonding is the electrical interconnection of all exposed and
          extraneous conductors, which may become electrically charged, in such
          a way that dangerous voltages between any of the conductors, which may
          be simultaneously touched, are limited. Earthing refers to the
          connecting of one or more objects to the earth (zero potential) by a
          conducting strip. The integrity of bonding and earthing connections
          should be tested periodically, and particularly after equipment has
          been maintained or painted

            >Artificial humidification of the atmosphere</span
          >
          is useful in certain instances as a backup to other control measures.
          A permanent relative humidity of > 65% produces a very thin film of
          moisture on exposed surfaces, which provides a conductive path for the
          dissipation of accumulated charge. (Note: humidification is
          ineffective with petroleum products as the necessary conducting film
          cannot build up)

          <span class="ast-bold">Conductive flooring and footwear</span> should
          be provided wherever an easily ignitable atmosphere may exist. This is
          especially important in the case of gases and solvent vapours, since
          the static charge that can accumulate on the human body can be up to
          25mJ, which is often sufficient to provide the ignition spark.
