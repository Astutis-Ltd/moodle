      This category includes injuries caused by explosions either of an
      electrical nature, or those whose source of ignition is electrical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Electrical explosions include the violent and catastrophic rupture of any
      electrical equipment. Switchgear, motors and power cables are liable to
      explode if they are subjected to excessive currents, which release violent
      electromagnetic forces and dissipate heat energy, or if they suffer
      prolonged internal arcing faults.
    </p>
    <p>
      Explosions whose source of ignition is electrical include ignition of
      flammable vapours, gases, liquids and dusts by electric sparks, arcs or
      the high surface temperature of electrical equipment.

      Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC) have slightly different
      effects on the human body, but both are dangerous above a certain voltage.
      The risk of injury changes according to the frequency of the AC and, as
      discussed, rectified DC will commonly have an AC component (called
      ripple).
    </p>
    <p>
      AC is generally considered to be more dangerous than DC at the same
      voltage and current. The frequency of mains electricity (50-60Hz) induces
      muscular contractions which can:
