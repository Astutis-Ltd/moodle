    <p>
      Arcing causes a particular type of burn injury which is distinct from
      other types. Arcing generates ultraviolet radiation which causes damage
      similar to severe sunburn. Molten metal particles from the arc itself can
      penetrate, burn and lodge in the flesh. These effects are additional to
      any radiated heat damage caused by the arc.
    </p>
    <p>
      On its own, ultraviolet radiation can cause damage, with sensitive skin
      and eyes being especially vulnerable to arc flash. ‘Arc eye’ is commonly
      encountered with electric arc welding if the proper precautions are not
      adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arcing faults can occur if the energy available at a piece of electrical
      equipment is sufficient to maintain a conductive path through the air, or
      insulation between two conductors which are at different potentials. Under
      fault flashover conditions, currents many times the nominal rating or
      setting of a protective device may flow before those devices operate to
      clear the fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much energy is dissipated in the arc and, depending on the electrical
      protection, may continue long enough to inflict very serious arcing burns,
      or to initiate a fire in periods as short as 0.25 seconds, for example,
      which is not an untypical minimum time for fault clearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arc flashovers caused during work on live circuit conductors are likely to
      be particularly hazardous because the worker is likely to be very near to,
      or even enveloped by, the arc. Such cases often lead to very serious,
      sometimes fatal, burn injuries.

      Fires may be started by electricity in a number of ways. The principal
      mechanisms are:

      The injuries associated with fire are usually burns but may include other
      injuries such as smoke inhalation.
