      It must not be possible to start machinery other than by voluntary
      actuation of a control provided for the purpose. This requirement also
      applies:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          When restarting the machinery after a stoppage, whatever the cause
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          When effecting a significant change in the operating conditions such
          as speed, pressure, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>This requirement does not apply if:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Restarting or speed-change is without risk to exposed persons
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The restarting of the machinery or a change in operating conditions
          resulting from the normal sequence of an automatic cycle.

      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Where machinery has several starting controls and the operators can
      therefore put each other in danger, enabling devices, or selectors
      allowing only one part of the starting mechanism to be actuated at any one
      time must be fitted to rule out such risks.
