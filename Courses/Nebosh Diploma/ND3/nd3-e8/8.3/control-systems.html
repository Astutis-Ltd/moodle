    <p>
      A control system is a system or device which responds to input signals and
      generates an output signal which causes the equipment under control to
      operate in a particular manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The input signals may be made by an operator via a manual control, or from
      the equipment itself, e.g. an automatic sensor or protection device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signals from the equipment may also include information (feedback) on the
      condition of the equipment and its response (e.g. position, whether or not
      it is running or its speed).
    </p>
    <p>
      Failure of any part of the control system or its power supply should lead
      to a “fail-safe” (minimised failure to danger) condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Control systems must be designed and constructed so that they are safe and
      reliable, in a way that will prevent a dangerous situation arising.
    </p>
    <p>To be considered safe and reliable:</p>

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The operation of the control system must not create any increased risk
          to health or safety
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Faults in or damage to any part of the control system cannot result in
          additional or increased risk to health or safety

          The loss of supply of any source of energy used by the work equipment

          The control system cannot impede the operation of any stop or
          emergency stop control

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Faults in the hardware or the software of the control system, or
          errors in the control system logic must not lead to hazardous

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The control system must be able to withstand the intended operating
          stresses and external influences (e.g. shocks, vibrations, humidity,
          extreme temperatures, corrosive atmospheres, dust and electromagnetic
          radiation)

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Human error during operation must not give rise to hazardous

    <p>Particular attention should be paid to the following:</p>

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The machinery must not start unexpectedly
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The parameters of the machinery must not change in an uncontrolled
          way, where such change may lead to hazardous situations
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The machinery must not be prevented from stopping if the stop command
          has already been given
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          No moving part of the machinery or piece held by the machinery must
          fall or be ejected

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Automatic or manual stopping of the moving parts, whatever they may
          be, must be unimpeded
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The protective devices must remain fully effective or give a stop
          command
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The safety-related parts of the control system must apply in a
          coherent way to the whole of an assembly of machinery and / or partly
          completed machinery
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          For cable-less control, an automatic stop must be activated when
          correct control signals are not received, including loss of
          communication.

    <p>
      The measures which should be taken in the design and application of a
      control system to mitigate against the effects of its failure should be
      proportionate to the consequences of any failure. The greater the risk,
      the more resistant the control system should be to the effects of failure.
      In many cases bringing a machine to a safe halt may achieve the objective.
