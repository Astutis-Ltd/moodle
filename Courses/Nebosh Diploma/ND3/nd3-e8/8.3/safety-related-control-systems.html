    <p>
      A Safety Related Control System (SRCS) is the part of the control system
      of a machine that forms a safety function, i.e. it keeps the equipment
      under control in a safe state to prevent specific hazardous conditions
      from occurring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The safety function may be a separate dedicated system or it may be
      integrated with the normal machine control system. For example an
      interlock switch on a guard.
    </p>

        <p>
          The safety-related parts of the machine control system execute the
          safety function. The safety function is not executed by a single
          device, for example, just by the guard. The interlock on the guard
          sends a command to a logic device, which in turn, disables an
          actuator.
        </p>
        <p>
          The safety function starts with the command and ends with the
          implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The safety system must be designed with a level of integrity that is
          commensurate with the risks of the machine. Higher risks require
          higher integrity levels to ensure the performance of the safety
          function. Machine safety systems can be classified into levels of
          performance of their ability to ensure the performance of their safety
          function.
        </p>
        <p>
          Functional safety is the part of the overall safety that depends on
          the correct functioning of the process or equipment in response to its
          inputs.
