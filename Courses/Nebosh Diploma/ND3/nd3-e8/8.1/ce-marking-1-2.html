      The CE marking requirements under the Machinery Directive relate to new
      machinery. However, if a machine is modified to such an extent that new
      hazards are anticipated, this will be considered a significant
      modification and the same measures will need to be taken as for new
      machinery.

      The first thing to be established is whether or not the product is subject
      to the requirements of the Machinery Directive. The latest Machinery
      Directive introduced some new products such as pressure vessels, steam
      boilers and funicular railways, and omitted others such as electrical
      household and office equipment).
    </p>
    <p>
      Machinery listed in Annex IV of the Machinery Directive (and Annex IV of
      SMSR 2008) is considered particularly hazardous (presses, woodworking
      machinery, service lifts, etc.) and additional requirements must be met
      for CE marking and the declaration of conformity (see image above).
    </p>
    <p>
      Sub-systems and ‘partially completed’ machinery also follow a different
      declaration procedure (Annex IIB).
    </p>
    <p>
      Safety components are also now treated as machinery and given a CE mark.

    <p>
      Other EU directives also provide for the affixing of the CE mark, such as
      the Low Voltage Directive and the EMC Directive. The provisions of these
      directives (if relevant) must also be met before the CE mark is applied.
