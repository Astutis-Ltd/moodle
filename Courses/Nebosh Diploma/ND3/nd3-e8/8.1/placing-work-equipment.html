      Now the UK has left the EU, the requirements for placing work equipment
      and machinery on the UK and EU markets, including arrangements for
      conformity assessment, marking and labelling have changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      CE marked workplace products will be accepted in GB (England, Wales and
      Scotland) until 31st December 2022. This includes workplace goods which
      have been assessed by an EU-recognised notified body.
    </p>

        <p>
          The UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) mark is the new UK product mark for
          workplace products and other goods. From 1 January 2021 UKCA marking
          began to replace CE marking for goods being placed on the GB market.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 1 January 2023 the UKCA mark must be used on all workplace goods
          products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up until 31 December 2023 the UKCA mark can be placed directly on the
          product or on an accompanying document.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 1 January 2024 the UKCA mark must be placed directly on the
          product.
