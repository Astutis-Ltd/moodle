    <p>
      Call centre work is often repetitive and demanding and subject to high
      rates of micro-surveillance and extreme forms of measurement, and
      therefore stressful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chatbots are an AI-enhanced tool that can deal with a high percentage of
      basic customer service queries, theoretically freeing up humans to deal
      with more complex questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      An increasing number of activities are already recorded and measured in
      call centres. Words used in emails or stated vocally can be data-mined to
      determine workers’ moods, a process called ‘sentiment analysis’. Facial
      expressions likewise can be analysed to spot signs of fatigue and moods
      that could be used to make judgements and thus lower OSH risks emerging
      with overwork.

        <p>
          Wearable self-tracking devices are increasingly seen in workplaces,
          e.g. the use of GPS, radio-frequency identification and haptic sensing
          armbands in warehousing.
        </p>
        <p>
          In lot size manufacturing workers are provided with glasses with
          screens and virtual reality functionality (e.g. HoloLenses or Google
          Glasses), or computer tablets on stands within the production line,
          which are used to carry out on-the-spot tasks on production lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          The technology allows immediate, ‘on-the-spot’ training in any new
          tasks required to ensure the effective manufacture of any specific
          orders received.

    <p>
      ‘Gig work’ is often obtained by using online applications (apps). Not all
      online application logarithms utilise AI, but the data produced by
      client-worker matching services and client assessments / reviews results
      in scores that influence future client selections.
