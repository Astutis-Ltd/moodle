    <p>
      The concept of Artificial intelligence (AI) originated in 1956, at a
      series of academic workshops at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, United
      States in which a group of scientists set out to teach machines to use
      language, form concepts, improve themselves (as machines) and solve
      problems originally ‘reserved for humans’.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now there is great interest in AI research and development (R&D)
      with billions of dollars of funding being allocated around the world,
      notably in the USA, China and Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expectation is that AI will improve productivity. As a consequence,
      there will be implications for workers and working conditions, but there
      is little discussion to date on how the introduction of AI into workplaces
      will impact upon the occupational safety and health (OSH) of workers.
    </p>
    <p>In 2018 the European Commission defined AI as:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        “…systems that display intelligent behaviour by analysing their
        environment and taking actions — with some degree of autonomy — to
        achieve specific goals.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->.

    <p>AI systems are typically categorised as weak or strong.</p>

          <span class="ast-bold">‘Weak AI’</span> is where a machine relies on
          software to guide its investigation and responses such as expert

    <p>
      There are a range of health and safety issues arising as AI is integrated
      into workplaces, notably stress, discrimination, heightened
      precariousness, musculoskeletal disorders, and psychosocial risks
      associated with work intensification and job losses. Often, it is not AI
      technology itself that creates risks for the safety and health of workers,
      but the way that it is implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some examples of the current use of AI in HR, manufacturing, call-centres
      and the gig economy are discussed below.

    <p>
      AI-enhanced HR practices can help managers obtain seemingly objective
      wisdom about people even before they hire them. People analytics tools can
      aid employers to “measure, report and understand employee performance,
      aspects of workforce planning, talent management and operational
      management”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Detailed analysis of worker performance can significantly increase
      pressure of work and result in stress-related illness.

          Robots have directly replaced workers on the assembly line in
          factories in many cases, and sometimes AI is confused with automation.
          Automation in its pure sense involves, the replacement of a human part
          with a robotic alternative (e.g. a robot arm). Robots allow people to
          be removed from dangerous physical work and environments with chemical
          and ergonomic hazards, thus reducing risks for workers.

    <p>
      Lower skilled, manual work has historically been most at risk and is still
      at a high risk of automation. Now, automation can be augmented with
      autonomous machine behaviour or ‘thinking’. So, the AI dimension of
      automation reflects where workers’ brains, as well as their limbs, may no
      longer be needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cobots are now being integrated into factories and warehouses where they
      work alongside people in a collaborative way. They assist with an
      increasing range of tasks, rather than necessarily automating entire jobs.
      Amazon, Airbus and Nissan are all using cobots to speed up production and
      increase efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three major risks have been identified in human-cobot-environment
      interactions

    <p>
      Human-robot interaction can have both positive and negative impacts on
      workers physical, cognitive and social health, safety and wellbeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cobots can reduce health and safety risks to workers by undertaking
      mundane and routine service tasks in factories, which historically create
      stress, overwork, musculoskeletal difficulties and even boredom as a
      result of repetitive work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cobots can also introduce new physical and psychosocial hazards in the
      workplace through mismatches in work pace (workers chasing the robots),
      the potential for robot / human collisions or impacts, a workers
      responsibility to ‘look after’ a robot’s condition affecting work-life
      balance and broader considerations regarding the loss of the dignity of
      work.
