    <p>
      Computer Numeric Controlled (CNC) machinery is increasingly found in
      engineering workshops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most CNC machines are programmed with code generated by a Computer Aided
      Machining (CAM) programme, as part of a Computer Aided Design (CAD)
      programme, enabling the machines to repeat operations with increased speed
      and a high level of precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern equipment may be purpose built but many older machines (typically
      lathes and milling machines) are retro-fitted. Retro-fitting CNC devices
      to machinery that was originally designed to be manually operated, can
      introduce new hazards and increased risks to the operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      A previously manual machine will still present the range of mechanical and
      non-mechanical hazards associated with the particular machinery type.
      Automation of the machining process can introduce:

    <p>
      The degree of computer control ranges from complete control of several
      different machines working together, to partial control of one aspect of a
      single machine (such as constant surface speed cutting on a
      ‘microprocessor’ enhanced lathe).
    </p>
    <p>
      Safeguards should be appropriate to the risks posed. For example, at a
      fully programmable CNC lathe (where many sequences of high-speed,
      high-power machine movements may be under computer control) complete
      enclosure, by fixed and interlocking guards or their equivalents, is
      appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a ‘microprocessor’ enhanced mechanical lathe complete enclosure may not
      be necessary and safeguards more appropriate to a manually operated lathe
      may suffice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the speed and power of machine movements under computer control
      leads to increased risks of injury, the following safeguarding principles
      should be followed:

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Fixed and interlocked guards should be provided to prevent access to
          the danger zone during the automatic cycle
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Where it is necessary to have powered movement of a machine element,
          with the interlocked guard open (such as for setting purposes), this
          should be done under limited speed conditions with hold-to-run
          controls
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Enclosing guards should be used to help reduce noise, and control
          emissions of mists, fume and vapour, either from metalworking fluids
          or the material being machined

                Vision panels provided to guarding / enclosures must be suitably
                resistant to impact and damage that would affect the
                transparency over time.
