    <p>
      The client must ensure that a construction phase plan for the project is
      prepared before the construction phase begins. The plan outlines:

    <p>
      For single-contractor projects, the contractor must ensure the plan is
      prepared. For projects involving more than one contractor, it is the
      principal contractor’s duty.

      The plan is the basis for communicating the arrangements to all those
      involved in the construction phase, so it should be easy to understand and
      as simple as possible. The emphasis should be on the provision of
      information that is:

      The health and safety file is defined as a file appropriate to the
      characteristics of the project, containing relevant health and safety
      information to be taken into account during any subsequent project.

    <p>
      The file must contain information about the current project likely to be
      needed to ensure health and safety during any subsequent work, such as
      maintenance, cleaning, refurbishment or demolition. When preparing the
      health and safety file, information on the following should be considered
      for inclusion:

    <p>
      There should be enough detail to allow the likely risks to be identified
      and addressed by those carrying out the work. However, the level of detail
      in the health and safety file should be proportionate to the risks and the
      file should not include things that will be of no help when planning
      future construction work.
    </p>

    <p>
      All Information should be clear, concise and easily understandable; and in
      a conveniently accessible form.
