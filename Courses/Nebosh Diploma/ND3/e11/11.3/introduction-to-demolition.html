    <p>
      Demolition is one of the most hazardous aspects of the construction
      industry. The majority of accidents involve either premature collapse of
      structures, or falls from height. Fatalities and severe injuries can
      result from fairly minor demolition work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Demolition can be a high profile activity, which often attracts public
      interest, and usually requires stringent safety measures. Robust physical
      isolation is an essential component of safety management of a demolition
      project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Demolition work is included in the definition of ‘construction work’ given
      in the
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015
      </span>
      (CDM) and the requirements of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of the CDM Regulations will
      apply to demolition works.

      There are a number of demolition techniques available which may be used in
      combinations or at different parts of the demolition site. The techniques
      broadly fit into one of four categories:
