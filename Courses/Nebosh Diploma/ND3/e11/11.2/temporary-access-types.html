      Accidents happen during installation, use and dismantling of temporary
      cradles. Most accidents happen because of:

      Equipment should be selected, installed, thoroughly examined and tested to
      ensure that it is suitable for its intended purpose. Cradles should only
      be used by suitably trained and competent workers.
    </p>
    <p>When using cradles the following checks should be made:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Adequate floor covering, guard rails and toe boards to prevent

        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The equipment should be capable of fitting closely to the building
          and, where buffers or rollers are fitted, they should run against
          suitable features on the building.

    <p>
      If the motor on a powered cradle fails, it can make the cradle tip, or
      people may overbalance and fall while reaching out of the cradle. Safety
      harnesses with a short lanyard attached to specially designed anchorage
      points installed in the cradle help keep the workers in a safe position
      within the cradle.

      <h5>Work-positioning systems</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      A work-positioning system is a personal fall-protection system, which
      includes a harness connected to a reliable anchor to support the user in
      tension or suspension in such a way that a fall is prevented or
      restricted. A back-up system must be provided in case the primary support
      fails. Examples include: boatswain’s chairs, or people working on
      telephone poles.
    </p>

    <!--H2 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h2">
      <h5>Boatswain’s (bosun’s) chairs</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      A bosun’s chair should only be used for light, short-duration work where
      the provision of a working platform or other mobile access equipment is
      not practicable. A chair with a seat, a back and a central suspension
      point is preferable to a plank seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user should be attached to the suspension system by a harness and
      lanyard to protect against falls. A carrying point should be available for
      tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rope grab must be compatible with the rope type, rope diameter and/or
      energy-absorbing lanyard in use.

      <h5>Rope access techniques</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Rope access and positioning systems normally comprise two ropes, each
      secured to different anchors. The
      <span class="ast-bold">working line</span> is used for access, egress and
      positioning, and the second is the
      <span class="ast-bold">safety line</span>. The user is connected to both
      lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">The working line</span> is equipped with a means of
      ascent and descent and has a self-locking system which prevents the user
      from falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">The safety line</span> is equipped with a mobile
      fall protection system that is connected to and travels with the user of
      the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rope access is often used to access the sides of tall building when
      cradles are not suitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The technique is suitable for inspection and other similar activities but
      not for general construction work.
    </p>
    <p>The following precautions should be made:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The equipment must be erected and used under the supervision of a
          competent person and a pre-use check must be carried out
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Anyone using the technique must be trained and competent
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The working line and safety line should be attached to two separate
          anchor points
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          All equipment must be checked carefully before each use
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          All equipment must be maintained to a high standard
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Tools should be attached to the operator with a suitable lanyard so
          that they cannot be dropped
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Where a risk of dropped tools or falling materials remains, the area
          beneath the work should be fenced off or protected by fans, covered
          walkways, or similar.
