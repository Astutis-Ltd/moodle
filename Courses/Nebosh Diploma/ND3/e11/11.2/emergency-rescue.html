      The longer the casualty is suspended without moving, the greater the
      chances are of suspension trauma developing and the more serious it is
      likely to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term ‘suspension trauma’ is used to describe the situation of a person
      falling into suspension in a harness and then becoming unconscious.
      However, the loss of consciousness is not due to any physical injury and a
      more appropriate medical term is probably ‘suspension syncope’ (where
      syncope means fainting or temporary loss of consciousness due to a fall in
      blood pressure).
    </p>

    <p>
      Orthostasis (motionless vertical suspension) means that venous blood in
      the legs cannot be helped back to the heart to be oxygenated and
      circulated to the brain by movement of the leg muscles. The lack of blood
      flow to the brain leads to a faint. Normally during a faint the body falls
      to the horizontal position enabling blood to return to the brain. This
      cannot happen here as the casualty is suspended vertically. If the brain
      is starved of oxygen for too long it is fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The longer the casualty is suspended without moving, the greater the
      chances are of suspension trauma developing and the more serious it is
      likely to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      An injured person hanging in a harness awaiting rescue should be removed
      from upright suspension as quickly as possible (ideally within 10
      minutes), especially if the casualty has been motionless.

      In 2008 the HSE commissioned the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL) to
      conduct an evidence- based review of published medical literature which
      had conflicting advice for first aid and ongoing medical treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the review the HSE has clarified guidance on the first-aid
      management of a person falling into suspension in a harness who may
      develop ‘suspension trauma’. The key recommendations are that no changes
      should be made to the standard UK first-aid guidance of:
