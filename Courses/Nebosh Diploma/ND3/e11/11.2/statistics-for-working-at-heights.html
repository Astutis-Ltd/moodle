      In 2020 / 21 falls from height accounted for 35 / 142 workplace fatalities
      (approx. 25%) and around 8% (5 200) of all reported non-fatal injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the construction sector there are typically 35-40 worker fatalities
      each year, with falls from height accounting for 47% of them from 2015 /
      16 to 2019 / 20.

      Under the Regulations, duty holders (employers, the self-employed, and any
      person that controls the work of others, such as facilities managers or
      building owners who may contract others to work at height) must ensure
      that:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          all work at height is properly planned and organised
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          those involved in work at height are competent
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the risks from work at height are assessed and appropriate work
          equipment is selected and used
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the risks from fragile surfaces are properly controlled
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          equipment for work at height is properly inspected and maintained.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Duty holders must also adhere to the following hierarchy for managing and
      selecting equipment for work at height:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          avoid work at height where possible
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          use work equipment or other measures to prevent falls (where working
          at height cannot be avoided)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          use work equipment or other measures to minimise the distance and
          consequences of a fall should one occur (where the risk of a fall
          cannot be eliminated).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      In addition, collective protection systems should be given priority over
      personal protection systems, and passive systems, i.e. those that do not
      require the worker to do anything, take priority over active systems,
      which do (for example, attaching a lanyard).
