    <p>
      Workers and members of the public have been killed or seriously injured
      after being struck by falling or ejected materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first priority is to <span class="ast-bold">prevent</span> materials
      falling in the first place. This should be supported with additional
      measures to <span class="ast-bold">protect</span> people, to prevent them
      from being struck by any materials which do fall.
    </p>
    <p>The following precautions should be considered:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Safe systems are required for raising and lowering materials, for
          example, an enclosed hoist platform or carefully positioned gin wheel
          away from public areas
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Debris chutes should be used when removing debris into a skip. The
          skip should be covered to stop flying debris and cut down dust
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Materials must not be dropped or thrown into an uncontrolled area, and
          chutes used for debris
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Safe systems of work are required for dismantling equipment, for
          example, striking formwork or scaffolds to prevent components and
          timbers falling into public areas
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Debris netting should be provided to retain light ejected materials
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Plastic sheeting should be used on scaffolds to retain dust, drips and
          splashes which may occur when cleaning building fa√ßades
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Scaffold fans may be required to protect people below from heavier
          objects
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Covered walkways (tunnels) may also be needed where the risk is
          particularly high
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Material storage should be kept to a minimum
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Toeboards or brick guards should be provided, and materials should not
          be stored above the height of the toeboards or brick guards
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Protected walkways may be needed in some circumstances, for example,
          demolition sites where materials could fall into pedestrian areas
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Where the risk of materials falling cannot be eliminated the area
          should be fenced off, and access should be controlled to avoid times
          when there is a risk of being struck
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Warning signs should be prominently displayed.
