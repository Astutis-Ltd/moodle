      Mobile Elevating Work Platforms (MEWPs) are either of a scissor lift
      (vertical lift only) or ‘cherry picker’ design. Cherry pickers may have
      telescopic or articulated booms, which allow a range of platform
      movements. MEWPs may be vehicle mounted, trailer mounted, or
      self-propelled.

      The increasing use of MEWPs is believed to have reduced the numbers of
      fatal fall from height accidents in the construction sector. However
      between 2003 and 2009 seven people were killed as a result of being
      crushed between a MEWP and a fixed structure. Other fatalities have been
      reported as a result of a MEWP collapsing or overturning, and as a result
      of operators being thrown from the carrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      HSE analysis of reported accidents identified the following range of
      primary causes:

      Safe systems of work for using a MEWP can be developed by considering the
      hazards and corresponding precautions relating to the plant, workplace and
      operator.

          The right MEWP should be selected for the job, following consideration
          of ground conditions, working height, safe working load (people and
          equipment) and manoeuvrability.
        </p>

          The machine should be inspected before use to ensure it is in good
          working order and free of obvious defects. Ground and cage controls

      The platform should be of sufficient size and be fitted with edge
      protection comprising guard rail, intermediate rail and toe boards.

      Appropriate fall protection anchors should be provided, suitable for use
      with the fall protection equipment determined by risk assessment. This may

      Emergency lowering controls should be provided to bring the working

    </p>
    <p>
      MEWPs should only be moved with a worker in the elevated position if the
      machine is designed to do so and only on level ground. The route should be
      walked and checked for potholes, etc. beforehand. Jolts from wheel impacts
      will be amplified along the boom and may have a severe effect at the
      working platform.

      Outriggers, if fitted, should be fully extended and chocked in place prior
      to raising the carrier. Manufacturer’s instructions should be followed.

      The MEWP must be maintained in safe working order. Planned preventative
      maintenance should be carried out by competent persons in accordance with
      the manufacturer’s instructions.

      It is not normally necessary for personnel working from a vertical lift
      (such as a scissor lift) to wear fall protection equipment, other than in
      exceptional circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anchor points in the work platform should be rated and marked as suitable
      for either work restraint or fall arrest, and the numbers of people for
      which they are rated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A full body harness with an adjustable lanyard (used to provide work
      restraint and adjusted to be as short as possible) is used when working
      from a boom type Mobile Elevating Work Platform (MEWP).
    </p>
    <p>
      Retractable lanyards are often used to provide the occupants with maximum
      freedom of movement, together with immediate restraint in the event of
      impact or levelling system failure.

    <p>
      The use of fall arrest equipment within MEWPs presents a number of
