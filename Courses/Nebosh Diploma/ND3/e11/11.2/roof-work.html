    <p>
      Where the design of the roof does not provide permanent edge protection,
      such as a solid parapet wall of at least 950mm in height, temporary edge
      protection will be required to give protection for the full duration of
      the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      This temporary edge protection should be strong and rigid enough to
      prevent people from falling and to withstand other loads likely to be
      placed on it, and be designed in such a way that it is not necessary to
      remove it to work at the edge of the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guard rails should preferably be supported at ground level so they do not
      obstruct work on the roof edge. Guard rails can also be supported by an
      upstand at the edge of the roof, or by frames, counterweights or
      scaffolding on the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The structure to which the edge protection is attached should be capable
      of supporting it.

      Traditional pitched roofs have a pitch of > 10° and are typically covered
      with slates or tiles. Most falls occur from:

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the roof, typically slipping down the roof, then falling from the
          eaves

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the roof, falling internally, for example, during roof truss erection,

      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Falls from sloping roofs are more likely if the pitch is steep, if the
      surface is slippery from, for example, moisture, ice, snow, moss or
      lichens, and in windy conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless work is of very short duration, full edge protection is required on
      all roof elevations to which access is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The potential loading on edge protection when a person slides down a
      pitched roof onto it is much greater than when falling against edge
      protection on a flat roof. The scaffold supplier should design the edge
      protection to be suitable for the pitch of the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      If work on the roof requires access within 2m of gable ends, then edge
      protection will be needed at those edges. At gable ends there should be
      one or more working platforms between the eaves height and the ridge. The
      distance from the highest working platform to the ridge should be no more
      than one lift high.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scaffold platform at eaves level provides a good standard of edge
      protection, a working platform and storage space for materials. The
      working platform should be as close as possible to the eaves, and is
      recommended to be no greater than 300mm below eaves level. Brick guards
      will be necessary if materials, such as roof slates, are stacked above
      toeboard height. They can also reduce gaps between guard rails, but need
      to be designed for this purpose (taking account of the pitch of the roof)
      and securely fixed.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      On most sloping roofs, suitable roof ladders or crawling boards will be
      required in addition to edge protection. It may be safe to work without a
      roof ladder where a high standard of edge protection is provided, the
      pitch is shallow, and the surface provides particularly good foothold and
      is non-fragile. The decision should be made following a risk assessment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roof ladders or crawling boards should be: long enough to span at least
      three rafters, strong enough to support workers, and secured or placed to
      prevent accidental movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top of the roof ladder should not be anchored against the ridge tiles,
      as they are liable to break away from the ridge. The weight should bear on
      the opposite slope by a properly designed and manufactured ridge hook, or
      be secured by other means.
