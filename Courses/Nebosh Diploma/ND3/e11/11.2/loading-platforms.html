    <p>
      Loading platforms typically use scissor mechanisms to raise and lower
      materials positioned on the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Permanent loading platforms, as used in warehouses or in factories, should
      be constructed and designed to carry the foreseeable maximum load safely.
      Temporary loading platforms, as on building sites, should be clearly
      marked with the maximum load that they are designed to carry, and lift
      truck operators should be advised of this load.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fork lift truck operators should take care to ensure that the lift truck
      does not damage the platform or its supporting structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      High loading platforms are common in the aviation sector for loading and
      unloading aircraft during turnarounds – for example, catering vehicles are
      designed to allow rapid transfer of catering trolleys and other supplies
      to and from an aircraft, ambulifts are designed to allow disabled
      passengers to board the aircraft instead of being carried on. They
      normally consist of a van body mounted on a standard vehicle chassis. The
      van body is raised up to the aircraft door by a scissor lift mechanism.
      Access to and from the aircraft door is via a platform, which is often
      fitted with a bridge plate to provide an interface with the aircraft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time pressures at turnaround, plus varying designs of high loader and
      aircraft, mean that workers and trolleys can be at significant risk of
      falling from height.
