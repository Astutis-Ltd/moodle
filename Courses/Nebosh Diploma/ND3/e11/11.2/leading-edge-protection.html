    <p>
      Purlin trolleys are used as an alternative to fall arrest systems and
      safety netting during roofing operations, and are suitable for many
      industrial roofing situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purlin trolley systems are essentially passive systems and offer
      collective protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exposed leading edge (i.e. the opposite side to that being worked on)
      is protected at all times, prior-to and following roof sheet installation,
      as the fixed double guardrail is always in front of the roofing
      operations.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      The systems provide a safety deck for the users to walk on, and to store
      their hand tools. No access is required to the area below the roof for the
      installation and use of purlin trolley systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      The working edge is protected by a support framework, positioned between
      the roof purlins, which prevent the operative falling into the gap when
      the trolley is moved along, as the installation progresses.
