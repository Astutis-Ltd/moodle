    <p>
      Guard rails will, in many cases, be the best option for fall prevention as
      they are passive and afford collective protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      When used as roof edge protection, guard rails should include or be
      equivalent to:

    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Work restraint is a personal fall prevention system, whereby the user is
      physically prevented from reaching an edge by using a harness and a fixed
      length lanyard attached to a suitably located anchor.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      A fall arrest system uses a harness connected to a reliable anchor to
      arrest and restrict a fall, preventing the user from colliding with the
      ground or structure whilst limiting the forces on the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The means of absorbing energy and limiting the forces on the body, once
      deployed, is either an energy-absorbing lanyard or an inertia reel.
    </p>

    <div class="ast-flex--center">
      <img
        src="https://mylearning.astutis.com/draftfile.php/524/user/draft/310894712/cgdi0477_harness_lanyard_and_shock_absorber%20V2.svg"
        alt="Illustration of harness, lanyard and shock absorber."
        class="ast-img--medium"
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      A typical fall arrest system will take 5 metres to deploy so there must be
      adequate clearance for the lanyard and energy absorber to deploy.
      Protection against sharp edges may be needed if the lanyard can come into
      contact with, for example, a sharp roof edge on deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inertia reels should generally be anchored in the vertical position (i.e.
      above the user) so that the fall factor (fall distance divided by lanyard
      length) is minimised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user should remain within a 30 degree cone (or as per manufacturersâ€™
      instructions) under the anchor, as deployment at a greater angle can
      result in the device failing to arrest a fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harnesses and lanyards should only be selected as the last choice for
      protection against falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anchorages and supporting structures, lanyards and harnesses, etc. should
      be compatible, identifiable, regularly inspected and the inspections
      recorded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equipment should be properly stored to avoid contamination with dirt or
      chemicals, abrasion or other damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users should be trained in pre-use checks and how to use PPE,
      specifically:

      Work equipment such as safety nets or airbags can be used to provide a
      safe landing by minimising the distance and / or consequences of a fall.
