    <p>
      Falsework is any temporary structure used to support a permanent structure
      while it is not self-supporting, either in new construction or
      refurbishment. Any failure of falsework may lead to the collapse of the
      permanent structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The causes of many past failures were foreseeable and could have been
      prevented by proper consideration when planning, erecting, loading or
      dismantling the falsework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failures often occur on fairly simple structures erected by smaller
      falsework contractors, who may not employ design staff.
    </p>
    <p>Regulation 19 of CDM 2015 (Stability of structures) requires that:</p>

          All practicable steps are taken where necessary to prevent danger to
          any person, to ensure that any new or existing structure, or any part
          of such structure which may become unstable or in a temporary state of
          weakness or instability due to the carrying out of construction work,
          does not collapse

          Any buttress, temporary support or temporary structure is of such
          design and so installed and maintained as to withstand any foreseeable
          loads which may be imposed on it, and must only be used for the
          purposes for which it is so designed, installed and maintained

      Falsework should be constructed in accordance with BS EN 12812:2008 â€“

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          designing falsework that can be erected, inspected and dismantled
          safely, including how striking (dismantling) will be achieved (it may
          be craned into position in one piece but could have to be removed
          piecemeal)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          selecting adequate foundations or providing information to ensure

          providing the information that the temporary works co-ordinator will
          need to manage the interface between the falsework and the permanent
          structure safely.

      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>All materials used in the falsework construction should be:</p>

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">free of patent defect</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          be compatible (i.e. different proprietary components should not be
          mixed, unless expressly approved by the designer).
        </li>

    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Once complete, all falsework should be inspected and certified as ready
      for use (a written permit-to-load procedure is strongly recommended). The
      frequency of subsequent inspections will depend on the nature of the
      temporary works. They should be carried out frequently enough to enable
      any faults to be rectified promptly.
