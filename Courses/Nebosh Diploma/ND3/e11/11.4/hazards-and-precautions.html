    <p>
      Digging foundations and trenches for drains is one of the first jobs
      carried out on a construction site. Work in and around any excavation is
      hazardous and accounts for an average of seven fatal accidents each year.
    </p>

    <p>The main hazards associated with excavations are:</p>

    <p>
      Excavations in non-cohesive loose sand and gravel, soft clays and silts,
      will be especially prone to collapse. Excavations in cohesive soils and in
      weak rock may stand unsupported for periods ranging from 30 seconds to 30
      days. However there is no way of knowing when such excavations will
      collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ground type markedly affects the probability, timing, and the extent and
      nature of collapse. The following factors increase the risk of collapse of
      excavation sides:

      Ground conditions should be regularly inspected by a competent person. The

        <p>
          Battering back the sides of an excavation to a safe angle to prevent
          instability is often the simplest and safest way of ensuring
          stability. Stepping the excavation sides by cutting one or more steps
          are cut into the excavation side(s) is an alternative.
        </p>
        <p>
          The angle of the battering / design of steps is dependent on the type
          of soil and its natural angle of repose.

      <span class="ast-bold">Walings:</span> Horizontal timbers (may be steel or
      aluminium in proprietary systems) that transfer the loads from the poling
      boards or sheets to the struts, or screw props which provide bracing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Hydraulic waling frames:</span> Used in conjunction
      with steel trench sheeting where cross services are encountered. The
      frames are designed to be installed from outside the trench, eliminating
      the need to enter an unsupported excavation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Puncheons:</span> Short sturdy vertical lengths of
      timber that support the walings.

      <span class="ast-bold">Poling boards:</span> Vertical boards to the side
      walls of an excavation.

    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Drag box:</span> Provides local support to trenches
      as a moveable ‘shield’, generally in stable or self-supporting ground
      conditions. Have rigid or pinned (adjustable) struts. Moved into position
      by an excavator.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Trench box:</span> Pre-constructed unit positioned
      in an excavation by an excavator.

      <span class="ast-bold">Trench sheeting:</span> Overlapping profiled steel
      sheets, available in 2 – 8m lengths, positioned vertically to the side
      walls of the excavation and braced with a hydraulic frame or traditional
      timbers with mechanical or hydraulic struts.
