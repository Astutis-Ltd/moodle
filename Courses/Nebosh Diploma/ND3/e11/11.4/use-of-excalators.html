              pedestrian exclusion area.

          A quick hitch or quick coupler is a latching device that enables
          attachments to be connected to the dipper arm of an excavator and
          changed quickly. When used properly quick hitches speed up the process
          and reduce the risk of injuries through manual handling and crushing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quick hitches fall into two broad categories: dedicated quick hitches
          or pin system quick hitches which may be manually operated, automatic
          or semi-automatically operated.

      There were four fatal incidents in 2007 involved semi-automatic quick
      hitches, and there have been many other serious incidents involving manual
      and automatic types.
    </p>
    <p>
      All fatalities involving quick hitches have occurred when a bucket or
      other implement has become detached and struck someone. The two common
      themes in all of the fatal accidents were:

          place against the quick hitch and insure against accidental release
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The victim was in an unsafe position either under the implement, or on
          its path as it became detached whilst slewing, lifting and or
          lowering.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>The key precautions that should be in place are:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The plant operator must be given sufficient training and information
          to enable him to know how to operate and check the quick hitch, and
          must be authorised to do so
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The quick hitch should be regularly inspected and maintained to avoid
          failure of the quick hitch or its mechanism as a result of ‘wear and
          tear’.

    <p>
      High risk activities such as bucket changing should be segregated in
      clearly defined exclusion zones.
