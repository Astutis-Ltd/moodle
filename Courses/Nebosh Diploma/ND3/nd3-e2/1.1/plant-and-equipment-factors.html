      <p>Selection and use of suitable equipment</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Any equipment provided for use in a confined space needs to be suitable
      for the purpose, for example, specially protected electrical equipment for
      use in flammable or potentially explosive atmospheres.
    </p>
    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>
        Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Respiratory Protective Equipment
        (RPE)
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The confined space should be safe to work in without the need for PPE and
      RPE. PPE / RPE should only be used as a last resort or for rescue work.
      The type of PPE provided will depend on the hazards identified but may
      include safety lines and harnesses, and suitable breathing apparatus.
    </p>
    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Portable gas cylinders and internal combustion engines</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Portable gas cylinders and internal combustion engines should not be used
      within confined spaces unless exceptional precautions are in place for
      ventilation.
    </p>
    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Fire prevention</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Flammable and combustible materials should not be stored in confined
      spaces that have not been specifically created or allocated for that
      purpose.
    </p>
    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Lighting</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Adequate and suitable lighting, including emergency lighting, should be
      provided. If used where flammable or potentially explosive atmospheres are
      likely to occur, an appropriate level of protection is required.
    </p>
    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Static electricity</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Static discharges and all sources of ignition should be excluded if there
      is a risk of a flammable or explosive atmosphere in the confined space.
      All conducting items such as steel trunking and airlines should be bonded
      and effectively earthed.
    </p>
    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Limiting working time</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      There may be a need to limit the time for work in a confined space, for
      example, when respiratory protective equipment is used, or under extreme
      conditions of temperature and humidity.
    </p>

    <!--H2 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h2">
      <h5>Use of a Permit-To-Work (PTW) Procedure</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      A PTW is usually required where there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of
      serious injury in entering or working in the confined space. The PTW is an
      extension of the safe system to work, not a replacement for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The PTW supports the safe system, providing a means of recording findings
      and authorisations required to proceed with the entry, and information on
      time limits on entry, gas testing results, and other information that may
      be required during an emergency.
