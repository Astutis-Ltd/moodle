          Regulation 5 states that suitable and sufficient emergency rescue
          arrangements must be in place before anyone enters or carries out work
          in a confined space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arrangements for emergency rescue will depend on the nature of the
          confined space, the risks identified and the likely nature of an
          emergency rescue.

      In some high risk cases there may be advantage in prior notification to
