      Safe ways in and out of the confined space are required. Quick,
      unobstructed and ready access should be provided where possible. The size
      of the opening needs to be sufficiently large to allow the safe passage of
      persons wearing PPE, and to allow adequate access for rescue purposes.

          The atmosphere within a confined space may need testing for hazardous
          gas, fume or vapour or to check the concentration of oxygen prior to
          entry. Regular monitoring of the atmosphere may also be necessary to
          check that there is no change in the atmosphere while the work is
          being carried out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherever possible, testing and sampling should be done without
          entering the confined space.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Where it is believed that flammable or toxic gases or vapours are present
      there may be a need to purge the gas or vapour from the confined space.
      This can be done with air or an inert gas where toxic contaminants are
      present, but with inert gas only for flammable contaminants.
    </p>

      <p>Ventilation</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Mechanical ventilation may be required to provide sufficient fresh air to
      replace the oxygen that is being used up by people working in the space,
      and to dilute and remove gas, fumes or vapour produced by the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fresh air may be blown into the confined space using a fan and trunking,
      or foul air may be drawn from the confined space if there is an adequate
      supply of fresh air to replace it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Checks should be made to ensure air supplies are not contaminated. Oxygen
      should not be used because of the fire / explosion hazards posed by an
      oxygen enriched environment.

      <p>Removal of residues</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Hazardous gases, fumes or vapour may be released when residues are
      disturbed or, particularly, when heat is applied to them. Appropriate
      control measures might include: the use of powered ventilation equipment,
      specially protected electrical equipment for use in hazardous atmospheres,
      and respiratory protective equipment.

      <p>Isolation from gases, liquids, and other flowing materials</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Confined spaces will often need to be isolated from ingress of hazardous
      substances. An effective method is to disconnect the confined space
      completely from every item of plant, either by removing a section of pipe
      or duct, or by inserting blanks. If this cannot be done a lockable valve
      may be used as long as it cannot be unlocked when people are inside the
      confined space.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Isolation from mechanical and electrical equipment</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Unless necessary to enable the task to be undertaken or to provide vital
      services (such as lighting or communications) the power should be
      disconnected, separated from the equipment, and checked for effective
      isolation. This may be achieved by locking off and tagging the switch and
      formally securing the key in accordance with a permit-to-work.
