    <p>
      A number of people are killed or seriously injured in confined spaces each
      year in the UK. This happens in a wide range of industries, from those
      involving complex plant to simple storage vessels. Those killed include
      people working in the confined space and those who try to rescue them
      without proper training and equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A confined space is defined in the
      <span class="ast-italic"> Confined Spaces Regulations 1997</span> as:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        … any place, including any chamber, tank, vat, silo, pit, trench, pipe,
        sewer, flue, well or other similar space in which, by virtue of its
        enclosed nature, there arises a
        <span class="ast-bold"> reasonably foreseeable specified risk.</span>

    <p>
      Some confined spaces as listed in the definition above are fairly
      straightforward to identify. However, this is not always the case as a
      confined space is not necessarily:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          enclosed on all sides, with some having open tops or sides, for
          example, vats, silos and ships’ holds
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          small and / or difficult to work, some can be very large, for example,
          grain silos and ships’ holds
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          difficult to get in or out of, some may have several entrances /
          exits, others have quite large openings or are apparently easy to
          escape from
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          a place where people do not regularly work, some are used regularly by
          people in the course of their work, for example, those used for spray
          painting in car repair centres.

    <p>
      If work that is being done in a space introduces one or more specified
      risks the space is a ‘confined space’ for as long as the work is being
      carried out and / or risk remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well as the ‘specified risks’, work in confined spaces may present a
      broad range of hazards associated with the type of confined space (moving
      parts of machinery, for example), or arising from a particular work
      activity with an increased risk when undertaken in a confined space (noise
      or proximity to electrical conductors, for example).
    </p>
    <p>
      The duty to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Confined Spaces
      Regulations is placed upon the employer, or self-employed persons.
    </p>

    <p>
      No-one should enter a confined space for work if it is reasonably
      practicable to undertake the task without entering, i.e. there is a
      presumption against entry / wherever possible entry should be avoided.
    </p>
    <p>Examples of doing work without entering a confined space include:</p>
