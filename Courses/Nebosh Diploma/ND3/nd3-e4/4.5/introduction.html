      Once a fire has started, been detected and a warning given, everyone in
      the premises should be able to escape to a place of total safety unaided.
      Staff will need to be appointed to assist people with disabilities or
      special needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Escape routes should be designed to ensure, as far as possible, that any
      person confronted by fire can turn away from it and escape to a place of
      reasonable safety, such as a protected stairway.

      Where an escape route needs to be separated from the rest of the premises
      by fire-resisting construction, such as a dead-end corridor or protected
      stairway, the escape route has several requirements.

      The escape routes must have adequate capacity for people to escape safely,
      in sufficient time, to ensure their safety in case of fire.

    <p>
      The capacity of an escape route is measured by the number of persons per
      minute that can pass through the effective usable width (narrowest point)
      of the escape route. The capacity is determined by a number of factors
