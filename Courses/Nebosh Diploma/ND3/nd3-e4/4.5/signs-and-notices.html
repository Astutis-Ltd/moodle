      As discussed earlier under Article 3 of the RRFSO the ‘responsible person’
      / key duty holder is primarily the employer in regard to any workplace and
      to the extent it is under his control.
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <p>In all other cases the responsible person is:</p>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the person who has control of the premises (as occupier or otherwise)
          in connection with the carrying on by him of a trade, business or
          other undertaking (for profit or not)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">or the owner of the premises.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->
    <p>
      Article 22 lays down the requirements for co-operation and coordination
      where two or more responsible persons have duties in respect of premises
      (whether permanently or temporarily).
    </p>
    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <p>Each responsible person must:</p>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          co-operate with the other(s) to enable them to comply with the
          requirements and prohibitions imposed on them by the RRFSO
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

          persons the measures necessary to comply with the RRFSO

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          take all reasonable steps to inform the other responsible persons
          concerned of the risks to relevant persons arising out of or in
          connection with the conduct of his undertaking.

    <p>
      In communal areas of shared commercial premises and houses in multiple
      occupation it is likely that the managing agent or owner will be
      responsible for shared parts of premises (risk assessments, site rules
      etc.) and shared fire safety equipment such as fire-warning systems,
      sprinklers, emergency lighting and signage etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each employer will be responsible for what goes on in their own workplace
      and all parties will need to co-operate and coordinate their activities as
      discussed above.
