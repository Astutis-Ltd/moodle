      Appropriate travel distances vary according to the level of risk in the
      premises (or part of them). Most workplaces will be normal risk.

    <p>
      Higher risk premises are those where there is a likelihood of a fire
      starting and spreading quickly. They are also those where a fire could
      start and grow without being quickly detected and a warning given, and
      affect the escape routes before people are able to use them. Higher risk
      premises include those where:

      Escape routes should be managed and maintained to ensure that they remain
      usable and available at all times when the premises are occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corridors and stairways that form part of escape routes should be kept
      clear and hazard free at all times. Items that may be a source of fuel or
      pose an ignition risk should not normally be located on any corridor or
      stairway that will be used as an escape route.

          People will need sufficient lighting to be able to find their way to a
          place of total safety, if there is a fire.

        <p>
          Where escape routes are internal and without windows, or the workplace
          is used during periods of darkness, including early darkness on winter
          days, then some form of backup to the normal escape route lighting
          (emergency escape lighting) is likely to be required.
        </p>
        <p>
          In small premises, where the escape routes are simple and
          straightforward, borrowed lighting from street lamps or provision of
          torches may be acceptable.

    <p>
      In larger, more complex premises it is likely that an automatic emergency
      escape lighting system will be needed to illuminate all the escape routes.
      Where people have difficulty seeing conventional signs, a ‘way-guidance’
      system may need to be considered.
