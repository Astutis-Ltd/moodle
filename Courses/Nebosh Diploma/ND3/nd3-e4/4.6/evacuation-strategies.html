      The primary objective of an evacuation strategy is to ensure that, in the
      event of a fire, the occupants of a building can reach a place of ultimate
      safety outside the building.

        <p>There are two basic approaches to evacuation:</p>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          total evacuation, which may be simultaneous or phased

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">progressive evacuation.</li>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Total simultaneous evacuation is the standard approach used in premises
      where it would be unreasonable to expect the occupants to remain in an
      affected area for a prolonged time, when there is a fire. Typically the
      fire alarm sounders indicate an immediate evacuation and all occupants
      proceed to a place of ultimate safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      A phased evacuation occurs in two stages. Key staff are alerted before the
      alarm sounders are activated giving an opportunity to investigate, confirm
      the fire, and prepare the evacuation response. A phased approach is
      commonly used in multi-storey premises where people on the storey most at
      risk are evacuated in the first instance, and then the remaining storeys
      are evacuated at phased intervals.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Progressive evacuation strategies</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Progressive horizontal evacuation strategies are typically used in
      hospitals and nursing homes. Vulnerable people are initially evacuated
      into an adjoining fire compartment on the same storey, allowing time for
      the fire service response and organising for full evacuation to a place of
      ultimate safety, if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoned evacuation strategies are often adopted in large retail
      developments, to avoid significant operational losses as a consequence of
      a relatively small fire. Occupants are moved away from the affected zone
      to an adjacent zone, while the fire-affected zone is brought under
      control.
