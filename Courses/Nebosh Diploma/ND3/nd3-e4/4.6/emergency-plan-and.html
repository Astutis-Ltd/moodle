    <p>
      The purpose of an emergency plan is to ensure that the people in the
      premises know what to do if there is a fire and that the premises can be
      safely evacuated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emergency plan should be based on the outcome of the fire risk
      assessment and be available for employees, their representatives (where
      appointed) and the enforcing authority.

          In simple premises the emergency plan may be no more than the fire

          In multi-occupied, larger and more complex premises, the emergency
          plan will need to be more detailed and may require consultation with
          other occupiers and others who have control over the building.

    <p>
      Contingency plans may be required for specific actions and / or the
      mobilisation of specialist resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where a site has the potential for a major incident the emergency services
      may prepare an emergency procedure (or major incident) plan for dealing
      with the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liaison with the emergency services is essential to ensure that company
      contingency plans are compatible with the emergency procedure plan.
