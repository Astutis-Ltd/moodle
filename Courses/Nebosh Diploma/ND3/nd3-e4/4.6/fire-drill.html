    <p>
      The best way to evaluate the effectiveness of the emergency plan is to
      perform a fire drill. This should be carried out at least once a year, but
      may need to be carried out more often in some workplaces, such as those
      with a high staff turnover, for example.
    </p>
    <p>
      A well-planned and executed fire drill will confirm understanding of the
      training and provide helpful information for future training.

          The responsible person should determine the possible objectives of the
          drill such as to:

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          identify any weaknesses in the evacuation strategy

      Within each building the evacuation should be for all occupants, except
      those who may need to ensure the security of the premises, or people who,
      on a risk-assessed basis, are required to remain with particular equipment
      or processes that cannot be closed down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Premises that consist of several buildings on the same site should be
      dealt with one building at a time, over an appropriate period, unless the
      emergency procedure dictates otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where appropriate it may be helpful to include members of the public in
      the fire drill – ensuring that all necessary health and safety issues are
      addressed beforehand.

    <p>
      For premises that have more than one escape route, the escape plan should
      be designed to evacuate all people, on the assumption that one exit or
      stairway is unavailable because of the fire. This can be simulated by a
      designated person being located at a suitable point on an exit route.
      Applying this scenario to different escape routes at each fire drill will
      encourage individuals to use alternative escape routes, which they may not
      normally use.

      A roll call should be undertaken as soon as possible at the designated
      assembly point(s), and / or after the fire warden’s reports following
      their ‘sweep’ of the premises. People who are unaccounted for should be
      noted. In a real evacuation this information will need to be passed to the
      fire and rescue service on arrival.

      Once the roll call is complete, or all reports have been received, allow
      people to return to the building. If the fire-warning system is monitored,
      inform the alarm receiving centre that the drill has now been completed
      and record the outcomes of the drill.

    <p>
      On-the-spot debriefs are useful to discuss the fire drill, encouraging
      feedback from everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, reports from fire wardens and observations from people should be
      collated and reviewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any conclusions and remedial actions should be recorded and implemented.
