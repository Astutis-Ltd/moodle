    <p>
      The <span class="ast-italic"> Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety)</span> Order
      2005 places duties on ‘enforcing authorities’ to enforce fire safety in
      non-domestic premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fire and Rescue Authority is normally the main enforcing authority for
      the Order but there are some special areas where others have been
      appointed as the enforcing authority.

          The HSE has enforcement responsibility for
          <span class="ast-bold"> process fire precautions</span>
          (e.g under the
          <span class="ast-italic">
            Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations </span
          >– DSEAR) and
          <span class="ast-bold">general fire precautions</span> under the RRFSO
          in the following sectors:

    <p>
      The <span class="ast-italic"> Office for Nuclear Regulation</span> (ONR)
      enforces process fire precautions and general fire precautions in any
      premises for which a licence or permit is required under the
      <span class="ast-italic"> Nuclear Installations Act 1965 </span>and for
      Crown Premises that would otherwise require such a license or permit. The
      ONR became a public corporation, separate from HSE, in 2014.
    </p>
    <p>
      Local authorities (LA) have enforcement responsibility at designated
      sports grounds and regulated stands under the
      <span class="ast-italic"> Safety of Sports Grounds Acts 1975 </span>and
      the
      <span class="ast-italic">
        Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987. </span
      >Where a sports ground contains a regulated stand, the local authority is
      the enforcing authority only for the stand and the Fire and Rescue
      Authority (FRA) is the enforcing authority for the rest of the sports
      ground. In practise the LA and FRA may well be the same authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fire Inspectors of the Crown Premises Inspection Group are responsible for
      enforcement of RRFSO in all civilian prisons, young offenders
      institutions, immigration detention, holding or removal centres, court
      custody suites, customs and excise detention areas regardless of whether
      they are operated by a Government department or contracted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chief Fire Officers Association (CFAO) has prepared an Enforcement
      Management Model and extensive procedural guidance, including audit and
      inspection procedures, to assist Fire and Rescue Authorities in their work
      under the Order. The model is based on that used by the HSE.
