          The main enforcing authority for the Order will normally be the local
          Fire and Rescue Authority (FRA). However there are some special areas

          construction sectors (Note: There is also potential overlap in other

          – see Element C4 for DSEAR)

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->
    <p>
      An alterations notice may be served in relation to premises which, due to
      their nature, constitute a serious risk to relevant persons, or may do so
      if a change is made to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where a notice is in force, the responsible person must notify the
      enforcing authority of any proposed changes in relation to the premises,
      which may result in a significant increase in risk to persons in the event
      of fire.
    </p>
    <p>An alterations notice may also contain requirements to:</p>
    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

    <p>
      These additional requirements are at the discretion of the enforcing
      authority and should be applied, as appropriate, in the circumstances of
      the case.

    <p>
      Examples of premises where use of an alterations notice may be appropriate
      could include:

          buildings where a fire engineered solution has been incorporated
          within the building design in order to satisfy the functional

      <p>Article 30: Enforcement notices</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      An enforcement notice can only be served where the enforcing authority is
      of the opinion that the responsible person has failed to comply with any
      provision of the Order (or of regulations made under it).
    </p>
    <p>
      The measures which could be required to be taken by a notice are limited
      to those which are necessary to ensure the failure is remedied.
    </p>
    <p>
      An enforcement notice should set out why the responsible person has not
      complied with the Order and set out the provisions which have not been
      complied with. The notice may be framed to give the responsible person a
      choice between different ways of remedying the contravention – but in some
      cases, there may only be one solution which would adequately remedy the
      contravention, and it would be counterproductive, time consuming and
      costly to suggest there is a valid alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enforcing authority must give the responsible person at least 28 days
      to remedy the failure. Any notice issued may be withdrawn or extended, if
      no appeal is pending.
    </p>
    <p>
      The right of appeal is by way of ‘complaint for an order’ at the
      Magistrates’ Courts.

    <p>
      A notice served under Article 31 is the most stringent measure that can be
      instigated by an enforcing authority whilst exercising its powers under
      the Order.
    </p>
    <p>
      This article enables the enforcing authority to act in cases where it is
      essential to act quickly, to ensure the safety of relevant persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notice can prohibit or restrict the use of a premises or building to
      which it is applied.
