    <p>
      The Building Regulations contain rules for building work in new and
      altered buildings to make them safe and accessible and to limit waste and
      environmental damage. People carrying out building work must usually
      arrange for their work to be checked by an independent third party (for
      example, the local authority building control department or the National
      House Building Council NHBC) to make sure that their work meets the
      required standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regulation 7 requires that all building work is carried out with adequate
      and proper materials which are appropriate for the circumstances in which
      they are used, adequately prepared, and used so as adequately to perform
      the functions for which they are designed, and in a workmanlike manner.
