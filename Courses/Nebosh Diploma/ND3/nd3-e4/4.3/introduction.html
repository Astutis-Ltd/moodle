        Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010,</span

      requires that buildings are:

    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        …designed and constructed so that there are appropriate provisions for
        the early warning of fire, and appropriate means of escape in case of
        fire from the building to a place of safety outside the building capable
        of being safely and effectively used at all material times.

    <p>
      In most buildings fires are detected by people seeing or smelling the
      effects and often nothing more is required. In small buildings / premises
      the alarm may be raised by simple means, such as shouting ‘FIRE’, or using
      manually operated sounders, such as rotary gongs or hand bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where this is not sufficient, a suitable electrically operated fire
      warning system should be provided, with manual call points adjacent to
      exit doors and sufficient sounders to be clearly audible throughout the
      building.

      Electrically operated fire alarm systems should comply with BS 5839-1:

      system design, installation commissioning and maintenance of systems in
      non-domestic premises.

          A manual alarm system consists of break-glass units and alarm sounders
          connected to a control panel, and can only be activated by an
          individual operating a break glass unit after detecting a fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          An automatic system adds smoke and heat detectors to the above, and is
          designed to raise the alarm to give early warning, whether or not
          people are present.
        </p>
        <p>
          The emphasis of a category L system is to ensure people are quickly
          and safely evacuated. This is a ‘people out’ approach.

          Information from a fire detector signal is sent to and processed by
          the fire alarm control panel. Fire detection systems are further
          classified according to the way the information is sent and processed
          as either:
        </p>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">conventional monitored systems</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          addressable systems (including addressable analogue).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      In a conventional monitored system the detection points (either smoke or
      heat) are wired in radial circuits from the control panel. At the end of
      each circuit, a resistor or semiconductor device creates a known
      resistance across the circuit, providing a steady-state reference. If a
      detector is activated by a fire, the steady-state resistance of the
      circuit to which it is connected will be altered, and the fire alarm will
      be raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      As each radial circuit from the control panel will have a number of
      detectors connected to it, identification of the location of a fire is
      limited to the affected circuit (or Zone).
    </p>
    <p>
      In an addressable system detectors are connected in loops rather than
      radial circuits, and each detector is allocated a unique identification
      ‘address’. Addressable analogue systems use detectors that constantly
      relay information on their operating condition to the control panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fire warning systems must be properly designed, installed and maintained.
      An installation and commissioning certificate should be provided following
      installation. Third party certification schemes provide an effective means
      of assuring a level of quality, reliability and safety. Certification
      bodies should be accredited by UKAS (United Kingdom Accreditation
      Service).
