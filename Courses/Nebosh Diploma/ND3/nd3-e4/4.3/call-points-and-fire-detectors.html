          A break-glass call point is designed to allow a person to raise the
          alarm, in the event of a fire, by breaking a glass cover to activate
          the alarm.

      A fixed rate heat detector has a sensing element (thermocouple) fixed at a

          <span class="ast-bold"> Ionisation chamber smoke detectors</span>
          detect smoke by the reduction it causes in current flow between
          electrodes in an ionisation chamber. The chamber of an ionising type
          has two plates set apart, one charged negatively and the other
          positively. A small radioactive source is used to ionise the chamber
          and the detector reacts to the change in electrical current caused by
          the neutralisation of ions by the smoke particles.

          <span class="ast-bold"> Optical smoke detectors</span> detect smoke as
          it obscures or scatters light. A light source and receiver are
          positioned opposite each other within the detector head. The system
          reacts to a predetermined drop in the light intensity at the receiver
          following the entry of smoke into the detector.

      <span class="ast-bold"> Optical beam smoke detectors</span> are
      effectively line type smoke detectors. They comprise a light source
      (usually infra-red) and a receiver. They detect the presence of smoke as
      it obscures the light source.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Aspirating smoke detection systems</span> draw air
      samples, by a pump or fan, through sampling points to a central detector,
      which may be an ionization chamber or optical detector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smoke may also be detected by video techniques, in which Closed Circuit
      TeleVision (CCTV) cameras monitor the protected space. The CCTV signals
      are analysed electronically to detect the presence of smoke as it obscures
      the camera’s field of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Combustion gas detectors </span>are point-type
      detectors that respond to one (or more) of the gases produced by a fire,
      for example, carbon monoxide.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Flame detectors </span>detect the infra-red and /
      or ultraviolet radiation that is emitted by flame. Both types use
      radiation-sensitive cells that ‘see’ the fire either directly or through
      built-in lenses or reflectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Multi-sensor fire detectors</span> contain more
      than one sensor, each of which responds to a different physical and / or
      chemical characteristic of fire.
