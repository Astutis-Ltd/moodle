    <p>
      Water is the most efficient, cheapest and most readily available medium
      for extinguishing fires of a general nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Water is generally ineffective against fires involving liquid fuels, as it
      sinks below the surface of the fire. It is not suitable for use around
      live electrical equipment.
    </p>

      <p>Foam</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Fire fighting foams have been developed primarily to deal with the hazards
      posed by liquid fuel fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are either protein based or synthetic based, depending on the
      chemicals used to produce them.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Carbon dioxide and inert gases</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Carbon dioxide extinguishes by smothering. Reducing the oxygen content of
      the air by about 20 to 30% is necessary to cause complete extinction,
      depending on the nature of the burning material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carbon dioxide is quick and clean, electrically non-conducting, non-toxic
      and non-corrosive. Most fabrics are unharmed by it.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Dry chemical powders</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Dry powder is very effective at extinguishing flame (‘rapid knock-down’),
      and is particularly valuable in tackling a fire involving an incident in
      which someone’s clothes have been soaked in flammable liquid, and ignited.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Halon 1211 (also known as bromo-chloro-difluoro-methane or BCF) was used
      as the extinguishant of choice for fires involving electronic equipment as
      it was non-conducting and left no residue. It was a very effective
      extinguishant that worked by interfering with the chemical reactions
      within the combustion process. Its general use was banned because of its
      ozone depleting potential. Various halon replacements are commercially
      available and carbon dioxide extinguishers are often used in its place.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Wet chemical</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Wet chemical extinguishers are designed for use on Class F fires (cooking
      oils and fats). The wet chemical rapidly knocks the flames out, cools the
      burning oil and chemically reacts to form a soap-like solution, sealing
      the surface, starving it of oxygen and preventing re-ignition.
