          Water supplies for a sprinkler system must reliably provide an
          adequate flow of water at a suitable pressure for long enough to fight
          the largest expected fire. This will involve one (or more) of the

      A valve set controls the supply of water to a sprinkler installation. The

      In a dry-pipe system a differential air valve is used so that a relatively
      low air pressure can hold back a larger water pressure. The valve also
      acts as the alarm valve.

      A sprinkler head is a heat-sensitive valve (the heat-sensitive element may
      be a glass bulb, or a fusible metallic link, or a combination of both)
      which activates at a pre-determined temperature (typically 68˚C – red
      bulb), opening and discharging water in the form of a spray over an area
      beneath, usually suppressing and often extinguishing the fire which caused
      it to activate.

    <p>
      In a wet-pipe system all the pipes leading from the water supply, through
      the various control valves and on to the sprinkler heads, are permanently
      filled with water under pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dry-pipe sprinkler installations are appropriate for applications either
      where there is a danger of damage to the pipework from the water in the
      pipes freezing, or in situations where temperatures may exceed 70&deg;C.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a dry-pipe system, the pipes on the ‘active’ side of the installation
      control valves are charged with compressed air under sufficient pressure
      to prevent the entry of water into the delivery pipework. Once the first
      sprinkler head operates, the compressed air escapes through the head,
      followed by the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternate wet and dry systems can operate as either type, and the premises
      occupier has the option of changing from a wet-pipe installation in the
      summer to a dry-pipe installation in winter.
