    <p>
      The Fire Office Committee of Insurers (FOC) published the first British
      standard for the design and installation of automatic sprinkler systems in
      1888.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Loss Prevention Council, (LPC) picked up responsibility for the
      updating of the sprinkler rules on its formation one hundred years later
      in 1988.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British Standards Institute (BSI) fully adopted the LPC rules as a
      stand-alone British Standard and published it as BS 5306: Part 2 in 1990.
    </p>
    <p>
      The standard was superseded by BS EN 12845 in 2003, this has now been
      updated to BS EN 12845:2015.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fire Protection Association (FPA) now publishes the LPC Rules for
      Automatic Sprinkler Installations, fully incorporating the requirements of
      BS EN12845+A2 in three parts, supported by a series of Technical Bulletins
      and Supplementary Information.

          A conventional automatic sprinkler system consists of pipes and
          heat-sensitive sprinkler heads connected to a water supply. Fire is
          detected by individual sprinkler heads, which open to release water in
          the form of spray, to the seat of the fire. The alarm is raised at the
          same time and the fire is kept under control until the arrival of the
          fire brigade.
        </p>
        <p>
          When sprinklers are present, the chances of dying in a fire are
          reduced by 50% to 75% and the average property loss per fire is cut by
          50% to 65%.

          As the action of the sprinklers is likely to reduce the rate of
          burning of a fire and the mass smoke flow, there are number of
          possible benefits to building designers, including:

      An automatic sprinkler system comprises of arrangements of pipework held
      on or near the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sprinkler heads are attached to the pipework, at pre-determined intervals.
      The pipework is connected via control valves, and pumps to a reliable
      supply of water.
