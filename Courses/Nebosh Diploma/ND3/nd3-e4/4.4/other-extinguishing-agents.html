    <p>
      Foam systems are most commonly used to protect flammable liquid pool /
      surface fire hazards. Foam is not suitable for live electrical hazards, or
      three-dimensional running fuel fires.

          Gaseous systems are an effective means of attacking fires in
          electrical risks such as:
        </p>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Electronic Data Processing (EDP) facilities, control rooms and
          communications equipment
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Ordinary Class A hazards, such as record stores
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Class B hazards, such as flammable liquid fires in plant enclosures
          and flammable liquid stores.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Gaseous systems are ‘clean’, as they limit smoke generation and leave no
      post-fire residues for clear-up.
    </p>
    <p>Modern gas flooding systems use halocarbons or inert gas mixes.</p>
    <p>
      Historically Halon was used in gas flooding systems, but its use as an
      extinguishing agent in the EU was banned in 2000, because of its high
      ozone depleting potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carbon dioxide has also been traditionally used, however its asphyxiant
      properties introduce a major hazard. In 2000, a US Environmental
      Protection Agency (EPA) study on CO<sup>2</sup> related incidents in fire
      scenarios reported that between 1975 and 2000 there were 51 recorded
      incidents involving the discharge of CO<sup>2</sup> fire extinguishing
      systems, resulting in 72 deaths and 145 injuries.

      <p>Dry powder</p>

    <p>
      Dry chemical powder is intended for use in extinguishing fires involving
      bulk chemical agents and liquefied gases.

      <h5>Water mist</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The term ‘water mist’ refers to fine water sprays in which 99% of the
      volume of the spray is in drops with diameters less than 1000 microns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Water mist systems are able to extinguish a wide variety of fires where
      natural ventilation, such as open doors and hatches, would render gaseous
      agents ineffective. Water mist also reduces compartment temperature and
      improves visibility allowing accessibility to the compartment during fire
      suppression. The potential for water damage however is a significant
      concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Water mist systems have been popular in the USA for several years. A
      European Technical Specification (not a Standard)
      <span class="ast-italic">
        CEN / TS 14972:2011 Fixed firefighting systems–Watermist systems–Design
        and installation</span
      >
      was introduced in 2011 and in 2020 was adopted as a British and European
      standard (BS EN 14972-1:2020 Fixed firefighting systems. Water mist
      systems. Design, installation, inspection and maintenance.)
    </p>
    <p>
      BSI has also published a standard for the design and installation of water
      mist systems –
      <span class="ast-italic">
        BS 8489 - 1:2016 Fixed fire protection systems. Industrial and
        commercial watermist systems. Code of practice for design and
        installation.</span
      >
      This gives recommendations for the design, installation, commissioning and
      maintenance of fixed watermist systems within industrial and commercial
      buildings.
