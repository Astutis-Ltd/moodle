    <p>
      The Environment Agency for England and Wales, the Northern Ireland
      Environment Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA)
      jointly produced Pollution Prevention Guidelines (PPG) which were based on
      relevant legislation and reflected best practice. Although the Environment
      Agency no longer provides ‘good practice’ guidance, a number of these
      ‘good practice’ PPGs are maintained in the UK Government National Archives
      as they continue to be relevant.

          PPG 21: Incident Response Planning sets out best practice for
          producing an incident response plan to deal with an environmental
          incident, and is aimed at sites which do not have a statutory duty to
          prepare such plans under the

          PPG18: Managing Fire Water and Major Spillages gives examples of good
          practice for the protection of the environment in the management of
          run-off generated in the event of fire (or fire water) and major
          spillages. The run-off generated in the event of a fire can cause
          long-term environmental damage that in the case of groundwater
          contamination may persist for decades or longer. Rivers, sewers,
          culverts, drains, water distribution systems and other services all
          present routes for the conveyance of pollutants off-site, and the
          effects of a discharge may be evident some distance away.

    <p>
      Major pollution incidents can be prevented, if appropriate pollution
      prevention measures are in place and immediately available. Contingency
      planning is essential to address both preventative measures and incident
      response strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emergency planning should consider fire-fighting strategies and possible
      methods of reducing the amount of firewater run-off generated, for example
      by the use of sprays rather than jets, controlled burn and the possible
      recycling of fire-fighting water, where safe and practicable to do so.
      This should be agreed with the Fire and Rescue Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Containment systems should be designed to prevent the escape of firewater
      run-off to drainage systems or surface water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Primary and local containment (bunding) will usually prevent an incident
      from causing pollution. However additional security may be required to
      contain firewater run-off, which may amount to thousands of cubic metres
      and remote containment systems may need to be employed to protect both
      surface and foul water drainage systems.

          Where such permanent systems are not feasible, or a fire occurred
          outside of a containment area, emergency containment arrangements will
          be necessary. Examples include:
