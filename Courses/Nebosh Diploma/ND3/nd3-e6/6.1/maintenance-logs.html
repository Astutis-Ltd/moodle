    <p>
      Maintenance logs are a practical way of demonstrating that work equipment
      is subject to regular maintenance. They are not legally required, but if
      used they must be kept up to date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some equipment may not be owned, but hired, by the user. Both the hire
      company and the user should establish between themselves who will carry
      out safety-related maintenance, and the terms of the agreement should be
      set out / recorded in writing with both parties should agree exactly what
      they are responsible for.
