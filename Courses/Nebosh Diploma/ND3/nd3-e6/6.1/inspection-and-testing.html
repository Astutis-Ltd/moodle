    <p>
      Regulation 6 of PUWER requires every employer to ensure that, where the
      safety of work equipment depends on the installation conditions, it is
      inspected to ensure that it has been installed correctly and is safe to
      operate:

          after installation and before being put into service for the first
          time
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          after assembly at a new site or in a new location.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->
    <p>
      Where work equipment is exposed to conditions causing deterioration which
      is liable to result in dangerous situations, it is to be inspected to
      ensure that health and safety conditions are maintained and that any
      deterioration can be detected and remedied in good time:

    <!--List Bullet Start-->

          each time that exceptional circumstances which are liable to
          jeopardise the safety of the work equipment have occurred.

      Where the general risk assessment under Regulation 3 of the Management of
      Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 has identified a significant
      risk to the operator or other workers from the installation or use of the
      work equipment, a suitable inspection should be carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspection is only necessary where there is a significant risk resulting
      from:

      The guidance recommends that inspection regimes are required for the
      following equipment:
    </p>
    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">fairground rides</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          machinery where the danger zone is approached during operation, such
          as injection moulding machines, guillotines and die-casting machines
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">complex automated equipment</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">integrated production lines.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->
    <p>
      The purpose of an inspection is to identify whether the equipment can be
      operated, adjusted and maintained safely and that any deterioration (for
      example, defect, damage, wear) can be detected and remedied before it
      results in unacceptable risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extent of the inspection required will depend on the potential risks
      arising from: the type of equipment, where it is used, and how it is used.
    </p>
    <p>
      An inspection will vary from a simple visual external inspection to a
      detailed comprehensive inspection, which may include some functional
      tests, dismantling and / or testing.
    </p>
    <p>Examples of inspections include:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          quick checks before use, such as electric cable condition on hand-held
          power tools, functional testing of brakes, and lights on mobile
          machinery
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          weekly checks, such as presence of guarding, function of safety
          devices, tyre pressures, and the condition of windows, mirrors and
          CCTV on mobile plant
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          more extensive examinations, undertaken every few months or longer,
          such as general condition of a ladder, close examination of a safety
          harness and portable appliance testing.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Functional or other tests (NDT of safety-critical parts, for example) may
      be necessary to check that the safety-related parts, such as interlocks,
      protection devices, controls, etc. are working as they should be, and that
      the work equipment and relevant parts are structurally sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The need for any testing should be decided by the competent person who
      determines the nature of the inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The persons who determine the nature of the inspections required and who
      carry out inspections must be competent to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The person who actually carries out the inspection should have sufficient
      knowledge of the equipment to:
