      <h5>The use of new technologies to facilitate safe inspections</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->

    <p>
      As discussed earlier, maintenance activities can potentially expose the
      workers involved (and others) to all sorts of hazards with the potential
      to cause serious harm. Some such as working at height and confined space
      entry must be avoided, so far as is reasonably practicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has necessitated the development of new technologies to ensure
      inspections of workplaces and work equipment at height and confined spaces
      can be checked remotely without the need to place workers at risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remote controlled vehicles and robotic devices are used to photograph and
      video internal surfaces of confined spaces, to take samples of contents or
      the atmosphere and to conduct non-destructive testing (NDT).
    </p>
    <p>
      Drones (Unmanned aerial vehicles) are used to conduct remote visual
      inspections of high rise buildings and tall structures such as offshore
      platforms and wind turbines. The use of high-definition cameras enables
      visual inspections to be undertaken remotely and the use of software to 3D
      model structures and plant and equipment is useful in advanced planning of
      work that may need to be undertaken at height.
    </p>

    <div class="ast-heading--h2">
      <h5>Record keeping</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Records are not normally required to be made for the simplest pre-use
      checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Checklists can help in assuring consistency of inspection and record
      keeping. The focus should be on what is necessary for safety. An excessive
      approach can be perceived as burdensome and can lead to superficial tick
      box type checklists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Records of equipment inspections do not have to be kept in a particular
      form, but should normally include:
