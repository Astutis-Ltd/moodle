      Under the
      <span class="ast-italic">
        Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998</span
      >
      (PUWER) the employer has an absolute duty to maintain work equipment in an
      efficient state, in efficient working order and in good repair. Here
      ‘efficient’ relates to how the condition of the equipment might affect
      health and safety and not productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quality of maintenance is a major contributory factor affecting safety
      and operational costs. It affects the operating life of plant and also the
      risk of accidents during or following maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The possibility of a fatal accident is present in many maintenance
      activities across all industries and continues to account for a large
      number of avoidable workplace deaths each year. In addition to the
      increased risk of accidents (during or following maintenance) equipment
      reliability and production can be reduced if maintenance work is not of a
      good standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor maintenance performance can have a direct effect on the health and
      safety of staff and contractors who carry out maintenance. Where
      maintenance is carried out in an area accessible to others, there is also
      a direct risk to the health and safety of non-maintenance staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor maintenance performance that leads to premature equipment failures
      can also have significant commercial consequences, even if no accident
      occurs, including:
