    <p>
      Maintenance programmes may be based on various maintenance methodologies.
      For the purpose of the NEBOSH Diploma the methodologies may be classified
      and characterised as:

    <p>
      Appropriate maintenance techniques should be selected through risk
      assessment and used independently or in combination to address the risks
      involved.

          This approach to maintenance consists of the application of standard
          industry work and repair practices to restore defective or damaged
          equipment to full operational capability and reliability and ‘as
          built’ condition.

    <p>
      Breakdown maintenance may also be taken to include end of lifetime
      replacement of equipment. This involves the continual operation of
      equipment until it has reached the end of its useful life, or fails in
      service beyond economical repair, and is then replaced with a new or
      reconditioned unit. Equipment may be replaced on failure or greatly
      diminished performance rating, reliability or operability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakdown maintenance cannot be scheduled and presents management, control
      and safety issues that are more complex than those presented by routine
      maintenance tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakdown maintenance is only appropriate if the failure does not present
      an immediate risk. It may be applied to stand alone, non-critical assets,
      after cost-effectiveness review and justification, and also to assets
      which are no longer in production and where the cost of spares and service
      would be prohibitive. It should not form the basis for the maintenance
      policy or take up a major percentage of the maintenance workload.

          Planned maintenance consists of: lubrication, oil changes, parts

          or work cycles.

      The approach can reduce unexpected failures but can be expensive as it is
      often carried out without regard to equipment condition.

      Designing an effective PPM programme for safety-critical machinery
      requires consideration of the following factors:

          Condition monitoring can be an effective tool for diagnosing the
          symptoms of impending equipment and machinery failures. It may include
          sampling and analysis, vibration monitoring, operating parameter
          measurement, Non-Destructive Testing techniques (NDT) and electrical
          testing procedures.

      The availability of trend analysis of deteriorating condition and early
      warning of equipment failure can help to reduce the number of breakdowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trend analysis is dependent on having established baseline data for
      original or satisfactory running condition, so that deviations may be
      compared against a fixed reference. Limits can then be defined as trigger
      points for action within the maintenance programme.
