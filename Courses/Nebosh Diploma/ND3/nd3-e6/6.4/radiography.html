    <p>
      Radiography uses X-rays or gamma-rays to produce a usually life size image
      of an object on film.
    </p>
    <p>
      X-rays and gamma-rays are very short wavelength electromagnetic radiation,
      which can pass through solid material, being partly absorbed during
      transmission.
    </p>
    <p>
      The source of radiation is either an X-ray tube or a pellet of radioactive
      material emitting gamma-radiation (usually cobalt-60 or iridium-192).
    </p>
    <p>
      Gamma-ray sources are much less expensive and much more portable than
      X-ray machinery, however exposure times are generally much longer than
      with X-rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      The radioactive source is placed on one side of a specimen and a
      photographic film on the other side, an image is obtained on the film of
      the thickness variations in the specimen, whether these are surface or
      internal.
    </p>

      Radiographic techniques are highly specialised and pose a range of
      challenges:

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The equipment must be used either inside a protective enclosure, or
          with appropriate barriers and warning signals, to ensure that there is
          no radiation hazard to personnel
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The radiographic film has to be photographically processed (developed,
          washed, fixed and dried) after exposure
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The images must be visually interpreted by a highly skilled
          technician.
