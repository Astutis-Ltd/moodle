    <p>
      Acoustic methods (also known as sonic testing, vibration testing or
      mechanical impedance testing) depend on exciting vibrations in a specimen
      by a local impact and then measuring some property of the vibrations such
      as resonant frequency or decay time. The most common acoustic method is
      the modern equivalent of the railway wheel tapper, using a controlled-
      energy impact instead of a hammer, and a transducer detector instead of
      ears. Electronic or digital data analysis and recording may also be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many specific acoustic techniques used in NDT such as resonant
      inspection, acoustic ranging and Acoustic Emissions Testing (AET â€“ which
      is discussed in more detail below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Resonant inspection </span>analyses the natural
      whole-body resonant frequencies of a component, which are determined by
      the dimensions and stiffness of the component. Changes in either will
      affect the resonances and should therefore be detectable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resonant inspection allows an entire component to be inspected in one test
      which will identify defects, material properties, dimensions, shape and
      coatings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Acoustic ranging</span> directs a burst of
      acoustic energy towards an acoustically reflective target object. The time
      it takes for an echo to return to the ranging apparatus is measured to
      determine the distance between the ranging apparatus and the object.

    <p>
      Acoustic Emission Testing (AET) is a very versatile, non-invasive way to
      gather information about a material or structure. It has many industrial
      applications such as, assessing structural integrity, detecting flaws,
      testing for leaks, or monitoring weld quality. It is used extensively as a
      research tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      The technique detects the transient elastic waves produced by a sudden
      redistribution of stress in a material arising when a structure is
      subjected to an external stimulus such as a change in pressure, load, or
      temperature. The stress waves propagate to the surface of the materials
      where they are recorded by sensors.

    <p>AET is unlike most other NDT techniques in three main ways:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The signal originates within the material. Instead of supplying energy
          to the object under examination, AET simply listens for the energy
          released by the object
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          AET deals with dynamic processes, or changes, in a material and
          therefore only active features (e.g. crack growth) are highlighted
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          AET can only qualitatively gauge how much damage is contained in a
          structure. To obtain quantitative results about size, depth, and
          overall acceptability of a part, other NDT methods (often ultrasonic
          testing) must be used.
