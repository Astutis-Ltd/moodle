    <p>
      MPI is used for the detection of surface and near-surface flaws in
      ferromagnetic materials, and is primarily used for crack detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The specimen is magnetised either locally or overall, and if the material
      is sound the magnetic flux is predominantly inside the material. If,
      however, there is a surface-breaking flaw, the magnetic field is
      distorted, causing local magnetic flux leakage around the flaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      This leakage flux is displayed by covering the surface with very fine iron
      particles, applied either dry or suspended in a liquid. The particles
      accumulate at the regions of flux leakage, producing a build-up which can
      be seen visually, even when the crack opening is very narrow. Thus, a
      crack is indicated as a line of iron powder particles on the surface.
    </p>

      Threading a current-carrying bar through a hollow specimen. The electric
      current used may be DC or AC of any waveform, but the current required to
      produce adequate magnetisation depends on the waveform of the supply, the
      magnetisation method used, and the material of the specimen.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using a combination of two magnetic fields, a swinging or rotating
      magnetic flux can be produced, which will detect a crack in any
      orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magnetic inks (particles suspended in a liquid) are used more widely than
      dry powders. They are applied by low-pressure spray, dipping or brushing.
      It is important to use plenty of ink and to allow time for the particles
      to flow over the surface and migrate to any cracks. On dark surfaces a
      very thin layer of white paint can be applied to give a higher contrast
      indication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fluorescent particles, which require UVA illumination, are widely used and
      coloured particles are also available. The indications of cracks can be
      preserved by photography or by the use of peel-off transparent adhesive
      film.
    </p>
    <p>
      MPI methods can be applied to relatively rough and dirty surfaces, but the
      flaw sensitivity may be impaired. Magnetic methods for underwater
      applications have been developed. Only under very special conditions can
      sub-surface flaws be detected by MPI.
