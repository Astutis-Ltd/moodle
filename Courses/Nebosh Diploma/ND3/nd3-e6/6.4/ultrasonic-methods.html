    <p>
      Ultrasonic testing techniques are widely accepted for quality control and
      materials testing in many industries, including electric power generation,
      production of steel, aluminium and titanium, in the fabrication of
      airframes, jet engine manufacture and ship building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typical applications include thickness measurements of thin steel plate,
      and internal testing of large turbine rotors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultrasonic methods use beams short wavelength (1 to 10 mm) and
      high-frequency (0.1 to 20 MHz) mechanical waves (vibrations) transmitted
      from a small probe and detected by the same, or other, probes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The technique detects internal, hidden discontinuities that may be deep
      below the surface.
    </p>

    <p>
      The techniques are effective on most non-porous, resilient materials used
      for structural purposes (steel, aluminium, titanium, magnesium and
      ceramics, for example) and can successfully test large cross-sections for
      minute discontinuities.
