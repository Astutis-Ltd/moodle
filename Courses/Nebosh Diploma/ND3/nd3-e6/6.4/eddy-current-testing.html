    <p>
      Eddy current testing places a coil carrying an AC current close to the
      specimen surface, or around the specimen. The current in the coil
      generates circulating eddy currents in the specimen close to the surface,
      which in turn affect the current in the coil by mutual induction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flaws and material variations in the specimen affect the strength of the
      eddy currents.
    </p>

    <p>
      The electrical changes in the exciting coil can be used to measure the
      presence of defects.

    <p>
      Eddy current testing equipment ranges from simple portable meter read-out
      instruments that measure voltage changes, to more complex oscilloscopes
      with read-outs displaying both phase and voltage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most eddy current instruments require calibration on a set of test
      specimens, and the flaw sensitivity can be very high.
    </p>
    <p>
      Applications vary from crack detection to the rapid sorting of small
      components for flaws, size variations or material variation.
