      There are many other techniques used for testing and evaluating materials
      and researchers continue to improve existing techniques and develop new
      ones. Some other common techniques are outlined below. An exhaustive list
      can be obtained from the British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing
      (BINDT – see reference section).

      <span class="ast-bold"> Leak testing </span>techniques use hydrostatic
      pressure, air pressure, or pressurised gases to find leaks in pressure
      containment parts, pressure vessels, and structures. Leaks can be detected
      using a range of techniques of varying complexity from simple soap-bubble
      tests to the use of electronic listening devices.

          laser shearography (or interferometry) which is used to detect sub

          laser ultrasonics which is used for defect mapping of contoured parts
          by scanning two laser beams over the surface of the part – one
          generates ultrasonic waves at the surface of the component and the
          other detects them.

      Thermography uses a television camera with an infrared sensitive detector
      and a lens to obtain an image of the heat distribution over the surface of
      an object. Temperature variations as small as 0.1°C can be detected and
      displayed on screen as shades of grey or a pseudo-colour image.
    </p>

      There are many specialised NDT methods which have found limited use in
      specific fields, such as microwave methods, proton absorption, positron
      annihilation, and neutron scatter. Generally, these are laboratory
      techniques, not yet commercially developed.
