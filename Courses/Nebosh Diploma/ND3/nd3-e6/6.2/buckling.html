          Buckling occurs when a material subjected to compressive or torsional
          stresses can no longer support the load, and it consequently fails by
          bulging, bending, bowing or forming a kink or other unnatural
          characteristic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bars, tubes, and columns are commonly susceptible to failure by
          buckling. L-beams and other more complex geometries may experience
          buckling under compressive or torsional loads.

    <p>
      Strength and hardness properties do not indicate a materialâ€™s
      susceptibility to buckling. Buckling is dependent on the shape and
      respective dimensions of the material, as well as the modulus of
      elasticity, which is dependent on temperature. Therefore, buckling is more
      likely to occur at higher temperatures where the modulus of elasticity is
      lower, since materials have a tendency to soften when they are heated.
