    <p>
      Brittle fracture occurs when mechanical loads exceed a materialâ€™s ultimate
      tensile strength, causing it to fracture into two or more parts without
      undergoing any significant plastic deformation or strain failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Material characteristics and defects (such as notches, voids, inclusions,
      cracks) and residual stresses, are the typical initiation points for the
      formation of a crack, leading to brittle fracture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the crack is initiated the material will undergo catastrophic failure
      fairly quickly under a sustained load. There is little energy absorbed
      (compared to ductile fracture) during the brittle fracture process. This
      failure mode commonly occurs in brittle materials, such as ceramics and
      hard metals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some materials, such as cast iron, glass and ceramics, are naturally
      brittle and prone to brittle failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inherently brittle materials are all intolerant to processing particularly
      if it involves changes of phase (such as solid to liquid) as their
      molecular structure cannot tolerate dramatic differences in volume or the
      mechanical stresses arising from thermal gradients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Case hardening is a simple method of hardening steel which involves
      heating the steel and plunging it into case hardening compound (high
      carbon content). The steel is then reheated until red and plunged into a
      water bath for rapid cooling. The case hardened material has a hard
      external surface and a softer, more flexible interior. The case hardened
      external surfaces are more prone to brittle fracture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of very low temperatures, impact loading and residual tensile
      stresses (within structural steelwork, for example) can increase the
      likelihood of brittle failure.
    </p>
    <p>Brittle failures look very different to ductile failures:</p>
