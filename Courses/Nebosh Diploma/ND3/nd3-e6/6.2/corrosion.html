      Corrosion is the deterioration of a metal or alloy and its properties due
      to a chemical or electrochemical reaction with the surrounding
      environment.
    </p>
    <p>Failure can occur either by:</p>

    <p>
      The most serious consequence of corrosion is a component or system
      failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corrosion manifests itself in many different forms, and through various
      environments and mechanisms.

    <p>
      Uniform corrosion is a generalized corrosive attack that occurs over a
      large surface area of a material, resulting in a thinning of the material
      until failure occurs. Changes in surface properties, such as increased
      surface roughness and friction, may also cause or contribute to component
      failure, especially in the case of moving parts that need to move smoothly
      against each other.

    <p>
      Galvanic corrosion is a form of corrosive attack that occurs when two
      dissimilar metals (such as stainless steel and magnesium) are electrically
      connected, either through physically touching each other or through an
      electrically conducting medium, such as an electrolyte. When this occurs,
      an electrochemical cell can be established, resulting in an increased rate
      of oxidation of the more anodic material (lower electrical potential). The
      opposing metal, the cathode, will consequently receive a boost in its
      resistance to corrosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galvanic corrosion is usually observed to be greatest near the surface,
      where the two dissimilar metals are in contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of driving forces that influence the occurrence of
      galvanic corrosion and the rate at which it occurs, including:
