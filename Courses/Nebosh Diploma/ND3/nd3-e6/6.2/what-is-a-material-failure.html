    <p>
      When a material becomes unable to execute the function that it was
      originally intended or designed to perform, it has failed. Failure may
      present as a fracture or total disintegration, or may consist of a change
      in shape, loss of material, or the alteration of mechanical properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary causes of material failure are operating loads, such as
      stress, impact and frictional loading, and environmental conditions, such
      as corrosive, high temperature, and high energy environments, with
      combinations of both often leading to rapid wear-out and failure.

    <p>
      Stress and strain are the key measurements used to understand the
      properties of the materials that objects are made of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stress describes the relationship between the applied force and the area
      over which it acts. It can be expressed as a formula:
    </p>
    <!--Blue Box Start-->
    <div class="ast-blue-box-container">
        <div class="ast-blue-box">
            <p>
                Stress = applied force per unit area or force &#247 area or F &#247 A
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!--Blue Box End-->
    <p></p>
      Stress is measured in Newtons per metre squared (Nm-2), which is the same
      units as for pressure).
    </p>
    <p>
      Strain is the measurement of the change in the shape of the material /
      object as a result of the application of the stress force.
    </p>
    <p>
      The precise definition of strain depends on the type of deformation
      produced. The simplest case is of forces of tension applied to opposite
      ends of a wire or rod which stretch or extend the length of the wire or
      rod. In this case:
    </p>
    <!--Blue Box Start-->
    <div class="ast-blue-box-container">
        <div class="ast-blue-box">
            <p>
                Strain = change in length (extension) &#247 original length
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!--Blue Box End-->
    <p>Strain has no units / is dimensionless, as it is the ratio of the two lengths. It can be expressed as a percentage change in length by multiplying the strain ratio by 100.</p>
    <p>Strain is also caused by the application of stresses other than tension, notably: compression, bending, shearing and torsion, as shown in the image below.</p>
