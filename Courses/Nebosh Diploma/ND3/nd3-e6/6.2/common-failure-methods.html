      Materials can fail in more than twenty different recognizable ways. The
      following common failure modes are specified on the NEBOSH Diploma

    <p>
      Fatigue is an extremely common failure mode which can inflict damage on a
      material at a stress level that is far less than the material’s design
      limit. It has been attributed with playing a role in approximately 90% of
      all material structural failures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fatigue failure occurs when a material fractures into two or more pieces
      after being subjected to a cyclic stress (fluctuating load) over a period
      of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maximum value of the cyclic stress (stress amplitude) for fatigue
      failure is less than the material’s ultimate tensile strength. It is often
      the case that the maximum value of the cyclic stress is so low that if it
      were applied at a constant level the material would be able to easily
      support the load without incurring any damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyclic loads cause the initiation and growth of a crack, and ultimately,
      when the crack is significant enough such that the material can no longer
      support the load, the material fractures.
    </p>
    <p>The fatigue failure mechanism involves three stages:</p>

          Crack initiation – usually at a ‘material inhomogeneity’, such as
          notch, groove, surface discontinuity, flaw or other material defect
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Crack propagation – the applied stress concentrates until it exceeds
          the local strength of the material and produces a crack
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Material rupture – when the crack has weakened the material to a point
          such that it can no longer support the applied load it will rupture,
          by shear or by tension.

    <p>
      Fatigue is not so much dependent on time as it is the number of cycles.

              A cycle consists of an applied stress being increased from a
              starting value (in some cases, zero or even negative) up to a
              maximum positive value (material loaded in positive direction),
              and then decreasing past the starting point down to a minimum
              value (in some cases this is a maximum negative loading), and
              finally back up to the starting value as shown in the image on the
              left.

    <p>
      Negative loading is not required for fatigue to occur, rather, it can be a
      fluctuating positive load. Moreover, the stress cycles do not need to be
      symmetric, but can be randomly changing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrous materials have a fatigue (endurance) limit, which is the stress
      level (amplitude) under which no failure will occur regardless of the
      number of cycles. Non-ferrous alloys, such as aluminium and titanium, do
      not have a fatigue limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Increasing the stress amplitude will induce fatigue failure after a
      smaller number of cycles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Metals and polymers are typically susceptible to fatigue failure, while
      ceramics tend to be resistant.
    </p>
    <p>There are several different types of fatigue including:</p>
