      As has been previously mentioned, maintenance work should, so far as is
      reasonably practicable, be carried out with the equipment stopped or
      inactive.
    </p>
    <p>Careful consideration must be given to:</p>

    <p>
      After external and internal isolation and dissipation of sources of
      possible hazards, a check should be made to ensure that no other hazard
      remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where controls are remote from the plant or machinery, the operator may be
      unable to see persons, such as maintenance personnel, who may be within
      the danger zone(s). In these circumstances, designers and suppliers should
      have ensured that the relevant controls and facilities are lockable, or
      such that they can only be operated by the use of keys or tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multi-pad lockable hasps or a multiple key exchange arrangement should be
      provided where more than one person is at risk. Each person should apply
      an individual padlock or key to each relevant control, or means of
      isolation and energy dissipation.
