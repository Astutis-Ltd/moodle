    <p>
      In addition to the requirement to maintain equipment in safe working order
      there is a duty (Regulation 22 of PUWER) to ensure that maintenance
      operations can be carried out (so far as is reasonably practicable)
      without risk to health and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The need for safe maintenance should have been addressed by the
      manufacturer at the design stage. Ideally access for maintenance
      activities should be achievable without exposure to risk, for example,
      safe positioning of lubrication points that can be accessed safely even
      while the machine is in motion, or adjustment points positioned so that
      they can be used without opening guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise the installation should be designed so that the work can, so far
      as is reasonably practicable, be carried out with the equipment stopped or
      inactive.
    </p>
    <p>
      If equipment has to run during a maintenance operation and this presents
      risks, appropriate controls should be introduced to reduce the risk, for
      example:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">provision of temporary guards</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">limited movement controls</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          crawl speed operated by hold-to-run controls.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The following steps should generally be considered to ensure that the
      risks arising from maintenance activities are well managed:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Staff undertaking maintenance activities should be competent to
          undertake point of work risk assessments including dynamic assessments
          should the nature of the work (and risk) evolve in unexpected ways
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Manufacturerâ€™s instructions should always be followed, unless there
          are good reasons otherwise
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Work equipment may need to be constructed or adapted to prevent
          exposure to risk or to protect against the consequences e.g.
          lubrication and adjustment points can be repositioned to be accessible
          at ground level thus avoiding the need to work at height
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Equipment should normally be shut down and any residual / stored
          energy safely released (e.g. pneumatic pressure dumped, parts with
          gravitational / rotational energy stopped or brought to a safe
          position) before maintenance work begins
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          For high-risk equipment procedures for isolation (i.e. disconnecting
          the equipment from the energy source) and locking off (i.e. means to
          prevent inadvertent reconnection) may be required
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          A permit-to-work may be used to ensure risks are properly understood
          and addressed and that any involved parties are clear on their role
          and responsibilities
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Where significant hazards cannot be avoided or engineered out
          appropriate measures should be taken to protect people and minimise
          the risk, including:
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Physical measures such as temporary guarding, slow speed hold-to-run
          control devices, safe means of access (e.g.
          <span class="ast-bold">
            hand holds and non-slip surfaces) and appropriate PPE etc.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          management measures such as safe systems of work, supervision and
          monitoring of personnel competence (training, skill, awareness and
          knowledge of risk).
