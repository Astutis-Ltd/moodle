    <p>The HSE defines a Safe System of Work (SSW) as:</p>
    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        … a formal procedure which results from a systematic examination of a
        task in order to identify all the hazards. It defines safe methods to
        ensure that hazards are eliminated or risks minimised.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->
    <p>
      A SSW is required when hazards cannot be eliminated and a degree of risk
      remains after technical control measures are introduced.
    </p>
    <p>The systematic analysis of a task may be undertaken in various ways:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          A Job Safety Analysis (JSA) may be used to break the task down into
          its component steps and identify hazards at each stage
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          A MEEP analysis may be used in conjunction with, or independent to, a
          JSA and uses the headings Materials, Equipment, Environment or People
          (MEEP) to prompt consideration of potentially unsafe conditions, and
          unsafe acts
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Other approaches consider what, who, where and how, or the 4 Ps –
          premises, plant and substances, procedures and people.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      A simple SSW may be defined verbally, as a written procedure or become a
      formal Permit-To- Work (PTW) (discussed later), depending on the level of
      risk and the needs of the organisation. In all cases the SSW should:

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          consider the preparations and authorisations necessary before
          beginning work
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          ensure the job sequence is logically and clearly planned
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          specify safe methods for undertaking specific activities
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          specify safe means of access and egress if relevant
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          consider the end of activity tasks such as dismantling and disposal
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Management commitment and workforce co-operation are essential to the
      success of the SSW. Employees should be consulted and involved in the
      development of the SSW.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the system has been implemented it will require periodic monitoring
      to ensure that it is workable and effective.
