    <p>
      Vehicle lifts are used throughout the motor vehicle repair (MVR) industry,
      including tyre and exhaust fitting centres. Two-post lifts have gained
      popularity over the last 20 years (they now outsell more traditional
      four-post lifts by over 3 to 1) at least in part, because they have become
      available at increasingly lower cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two-post lifts were originally used mainly for inspection and routine
      servicing (oil, tyre and exhaust changes, etc.), but are now commonly used
      for major work activities. Four-post lifts are still required for MOT
      testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two-post vehicle lifts typically comprise two upright columns – a master
      or powered column plus an auxiliary or slave. Some columns are connected
      by a structural overhead beam, which helps keep the columns rigid under
      load. At the free end of each carrying arm there is an adjustable pick-up
      plate fitted with a rubber mounting pad. A two-post lift achieves
      ‘wheel-free lifting’ by aligning the pick-up plates to four jacking points
      on the underside of the chassis of the vehicles.

      As front-wheel drive vehicles now dominate the market, the design of
      two-post lifts has evolved to accommodate the forward centre of gravity of
      front wheel drive vehicles. Lifts are now often manufactured with the
      front arms shorter than the rear arms (sometimes known as asymmetric arms
      or semi-asymmetric lift), so that the centre of gravity of the front-wheel
      drive vehicle can be placed approximately between the columns.

    <p>
      In 2005 the HSE highlighted the increased risk of vehicles falling from
      two-post lifts, where arm locking systems were either not fitted, or were
      defective. In 2008 further concern was raised regarding defective locking
      devices on some models of two-post lift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between 2005 and 2010 there have been a number of reported cases where
      vehicles have fallen from raised lifts, mostly resulting in vehicle
      damage, but some involving serious injuries, and at least two resulting in
      fatalities, in the UK.
