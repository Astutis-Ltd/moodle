    <p>
      Lifting equipment which is exposed to conditions causing deterioration
      likely to result in dangerous situations should be thoroughly examined as
      follows:

              <p>in accordance with an examination scheme</p>
              <p>or</p>
              after exceptional circumstances which are liable to jeopardise the
              safety of the lifting equipment.

    <p>
      Note: It may also be appropriate for the lifting equipment to be inspected
      by a competent person at suitable intervals between thorough examinations,
      to ensure the equipment is maintained in good order and that any
      deterioration is detected and remedied in good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The competent person is required to immediately notify the employer and
      enforcing authority of any identified defects involving existing or
      imminent risks of serious personal injury, for example:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">amputation</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">electric shock</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          fracture other than to fingers, thumbs or toes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The employer should then remove any such defective equipment from use for
      disposal or repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The competent person also has to provide the employer with a written
      report of the findings of the thorough examination, as soon as is
      practicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The employer has to keep available for inspection any EU declaration of
      conformity relating to the lifting equipment for as long as he operates
      it, and to keep the records of thorough examinations available for
      inspection as in the table below.
