      In order to implement the safe system of work effectively one person
      should be appointed to have overall control of the lifting operation and
      to act on behalf of the management of the employing organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appointed person should be notified formally in writing of their
      appointment and should be given authority to carry out the duties
      involved, including the authority to stop the operation whenever danger is
      likely to arise.

      The performance of the appointed person should be reviewed periodically.

      The duties of appointed persons vary according to the complexity of the
      operation, i.e. whether the lift is deemed basic, standard or complex.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <span class="ast-bold">basic lift</span> is one where the weight of the
      load(s) can be simply established, and there are no hazards or
      obstructions within the area of the operation. In such cases the appointed
      person should:

          Establish the weight of the load. This can be by referring to a
          reliable source of information, by weighing the load, or by
          calculation (with allowance for possible inaccuracies)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Select an appropriate crane, based on the weight of the load,
          including the crane hook block and any lifting tackle, the maximum
          height of lift and the maximum radius required
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Consider the location of the operation, taking into account the access
          and egress required for the crane and the suitability of the ground to
          take the loads imposed on the crane during preparation and during the
          lift itself
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Ensure that the crane is not operated in wind speeds in excess of
          manufacturer’s recommendation
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Ensure that the crane has been thoroughly examined at least within the
          previous 6 months (for lifting of persons) or 12 months (including
          testing where appropriate), and inspected and checked before use

          Ensure that the lifting accessories and any lifting points on the load

          Brief all persons involved in the lifting operation to ensure that the

          Ensure that there is a crane supervisor designated to direct

    <p>
      For a <span class="ast-bold">standard lift</span> any hazards, either
      within the working area of the crane or on the access route to the working
      area, or any areas required for access or erection / dismantling of the
      crane, should be thoroughly risk assessed and managed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A complex lift occurs when the location has exceptional hazards, such as
      at a chemical plant, during demolition or when lifting a load from height.
      A complex lift also occurs when people are being lifted, or the load being
      lifted is a complex shape or has a large wind area. In such cases an
      appropriate level of risk assessment and management is required.
