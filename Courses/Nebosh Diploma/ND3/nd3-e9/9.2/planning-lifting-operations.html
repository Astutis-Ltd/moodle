    <p>
      All lifting operations should be planned so they are carried out safely
      with foreseeable risks taken into account.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lifting plan should be developed by a competent person with adequate
      practical and theoretical knowledge, and experience of the lifts being
      undertaken.
    </p>
    <p>The plan should address:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the risks identified by a risk assessment
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">the resources required</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          procedures and responsibilities to ensure the lifting operation is
          carried out safely.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The plan should ensure that the lifting equipment remains safe for the
      range of lifting operations for which it might be used.

      advice on the key features of a basic lifting plan.
