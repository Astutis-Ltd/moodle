    <!--H2 Heading End-->

    <p>
      Overhead cranes are common in engineering works and plants where lifting
      access for conventional cranes is difficult, due to the layout. They can
      have a capacity of several hundred tonnes, depending on the ability of the
      structure to support the weight.
    </p>
    <p>Overhead cranes consist of:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Wall mounted runway beams which support the crane and allow it to
          travel along their length
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The bridge which is the main travelling structure that spans the width
          of the work area. At its simplest this would be a single bridge girder
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          End trucks house the wheels on which the entire crane travels. They
          sit at either end of the bridge and ride on the runway beams
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Trolley hoist, with the trolley carrying the hoist across the bay
          along the bridge girder(s) traversing the span, and the hoist, which
          is mounted to the trolley, performing the actual lifting function via
          a hook or lifting attachment. Hoists are typically wire rope or chain
          hoists.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Gantry cranes are similar to overhead cranes, but are not fixed to the
      building structure. The bridge is supported by a gantry framework which
      may be rail mounted, to allow horizontal movement.

    <p>
      There are many different designs of mobile cranes. Those most commonly
      seen on construction sites include:

    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Telescopic mobile cranes are suitable for short duration operations, and
      where mobility around or on / off site is important.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are versatile plant items which can travel to site on public roads
      and generally be positioned, rigged and in use in a very short time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically a lorry mounted telescopic crane will have a capacity of between
      15 and 1000 tonnes. Larger machines are available but lead to a loss of
      key benefits as additional counter weights, the boom and outriggers may
      need to be delivered on separate lorries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outriggers must be used to ensure stability. Care must be taken when
      positioning, as the outriggers must be footed on good ground.
    </p>

      <p>All-terrain crane</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      An all-terrain crane is similar to a lorry mounted telescopic crane. It is
      a wheeled crane with a telescopic jib, and a specially designed chassis
      that allows travel on the highway at normal road speeds. It incorporates
      features, such as additional steering and driven axles, to give it better
      manoeuvrability on site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most all-terrain cranes can be fitted with fly jibs and luffing fly jibs.
      They are operated as lorry mounted telescopic cranes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: An all-terrain crane is not the same as a rough-terrain crane and
      may not be able to travel over rough, un-compacted ground.
