          A rough-terrain crane is a wheeled crane with a telescopic jib that is
          primarily designed for working on sites, and able to travel on site
          between lifting operations over dry, firm, un-compacted ground.

          Crawler cranes are typically used on longer duration operations and
          for operations with pick and carry duties, and routine movement over
          relatively short distances.
        </p>
        <p>
          The high mobilisation and demobilisation costs associated with
          transport, rigging and de-rigging generally make them uneconomic for
          short site visits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crawler cranes are mounted on a track laying chassis, not wheels. The
          tracks give them great manoeuvrability, allowing travel over rough
          ground and access to tight working areas. The lifting capacity of
          crawler cranes is typically in the range of 15 to 250 tonnes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crawler cranes can be used to travel with a suspended load, but the
          travelling surface must be level and free from any underground
          hazards.
        </p>
        <p>
          They have an advantage over lorry-mounted mobiles, as they can
          generally be moved around site fully rigged.

      As with the previous machines there are various additional jib
      configurations, such as fly jibs or luffing fly jibs.

      Tower cranes provide coverage over large areas but occupy little space at
      ground level on site. The elevated control cabin gives operators an
      excellent view of operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relatively high mobilisation and foundation costs restrict the use of
      tower cranes to longer term operations. There are many different designs
      of tower crane available.

    <p>
      Trolley jibs are the most common type of tower crane. They are available
      in a range of capacities from 45 metre tonne to over 2 000 metre tonne.
      Versions are available without an A frame, for use when there is
      restricted headroom.

    <!--H4 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Luffing jibs can be used in place of the saddle jib tower crane where
      there is an obstruction to the free slew of the jib. Luffing jibs are
      available in a range of capacities, from 80 metre tonne to 700 metre
      tonne.
