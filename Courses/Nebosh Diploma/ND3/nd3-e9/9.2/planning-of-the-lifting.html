      The appointed person is responsible for ensuring that all lifting
      operations are planned to ensure that they are carried out safely and that
      all foreseeable risks have been taken into account.
    </p>
    <p>The planning process should take into account:</p>

          the site of the operation including proximity hazards, space

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      A risk assessment should be undertaken to identify the hazards associated
      with the proposed lifting operation. The assessment should evaluate the
      risks involved and the nature and extent of any measures required to
      mitigate those risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consideration should be given to hazards identified by the overall site
      risk assessments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The risk assessment together with the manufacturer’s instructions, should
      then be used to develop a detailed method statement for the safe
      transportation, assembly, erection, use and dismantling of the equipment
      at that site.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Once the risk assessment has been completed, the appointed person should
      ensure that a full method statement is prepared, detailing the safe system
      of work and including the risk assessment.
    </p>
    <p>The method statement should include:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->

          details of the steps to be taken to eliminate danger to personnel not

          if necessary

      </ul>

    <!--List Bullet End-->
    <p>
      The lifting operation will be under the control of a crane supervisor who
      has the authority to stop the work if local conditions are unsatisfactory.
      The crane supervisor should ensure that the team are inducted in the
      general site precautions and the specific features of the method statement
      before the job commences.

    <p>
      In general, any organisation requiring a load to be moved by crane, which
      does not have its own cranage, has two basic options:

          Lift).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      If an individual or organisation does not have expertise in lifting
      operations they should not hire cranes, but should opt for a contract
      lift, ensuring that the contractor is competent.

    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Safe system of work</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      A safe system of work should be established and followed for every crane
      installation operation or lifting operation, whether it be an individual
      lift or a group of repetitive operations. The safe system of work should
      be communicated to all parties concerned and should include:
