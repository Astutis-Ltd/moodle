    <p>
      The Lift and Escalator Industry Association (LEIA) has estimated that
      there are 250 000 passenger and goods lifts in service in the UK, each
      making numerous trips each day.
    </p>
    <p>
      HSE figures show 266 people have been injured and 4 killed in ‘elevator
      accidents’ (those taking place in lifts, hoisting devices and elevating
      work platforms) between 2002 and 2010. Another 182 injuries took place in
      lift shafts, service ducts, and cellar hatches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common lift-related injuries are minor trips, bumps and pinched
      fingers that are unlikely to be reported. More serious injuries can occur
      should something go seriously wrong with the electrical system or safety
      mechanism of the lift, but these are rare. The counterweighted design of
      passenger lifts should ensure that they cannot crash to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passenger lifts and combined goods / passenger lifts provided for use by
      workers in workplaces are subject to periodic thorough examination and
      inspection, as required by LOLER and PUWER (6 monthly if persons are
      lifted).
    </p>
    <p>
      LOLER does not apply to escalators or any travelators (moving walkways
      which transport people). This equipment is covered by
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >Regulation 19 of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare)
        Regulations.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Where a passenger lift is not used by people at work (such as in public
      areas of a shopping centre) LOLER and PUWER will not apply. However, if
      the lift is operated by (or to some extent under the control of) an
      employer or self-employed person in connection with their business, they
      still have general duties and responsibilities under the Health and Safety
      at Work Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common design uses traction steel ropes to raise and lower the
      car.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ropes are attached to the elevator car, and looped around a sheave
      (grooved pulley), which is connected to an electric motor. When the sheave
      is rotated by the motor, the ropes move with it and the lift goes up or
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ropes are also connected to a counterweight (approximately 40%
      capacity of a full car), which hangs on the other side of the sheave. When
      the car is 40 percent full (average load), the counterweight and the car
      are balanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the elevator car and the counterweight ride on guide rails along the
      sides of the elevator shaft, to prevent them from swaying back and forth,
      and they also work with the safety system (built-in braking system) to
      stop the car in an emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elevators are built with multiple ropes (usually between four and eight).
      Each rope is made of multiple strands of steel wire and is strong enough
      to support the weight of the car and the counterweight. In the unlikely
      event that one of the ropes snaps, the rest will hold the car up.
    </p>
    <p>
      If all of the ropes were to break, the braking systems would prevent the
      car from crashing to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>Passenger lifts have the following safety features:</p>
