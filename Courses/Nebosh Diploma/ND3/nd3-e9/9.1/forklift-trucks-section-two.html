          The tele-handler has a boom that pivots at the rear of the machine,
          and is raised and lowered by hydraulic rams. The boom can also be
          extended or retracted (telescoped) to give extra reach or height.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tele-handlers may be two or four wheel drive, and have two-wheel,
          four-wheel or crab steering.

        <p>
          They are used mainly in agriculture and construction and can be used
          with a range of attachments.

      The driving position of a side-loader is at the front and to one side of
      the lift truck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The load is carried on the deck, the mast being traversed out sideways to
      pick up or set down the load.
    </p>
    <p>
      Side-loaders are used for stacking and moving long loads, such as bales of
      timber and pipes, and may be fitted with stabilisers for use when picking
      up or setting down loads.

    <p>
      As with all work equipment a fork lift truck must be suitable for its
      intended use and the environment in which it is to be used. A range of
      features should be taken into account when determining the suitability of
      a truck, including:
