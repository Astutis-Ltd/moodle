      Mobile work equipment is any work equipment which carries out work while
      it is travelling, or which travels between different locations where it is
      used to carry out work. The equipment is typically moved on wheels,
      tracks, rollers, skids, etc. and may be self-propelled, towed or remote
      controlled and may incorporate attachments.

              The motor or mechanism may be powered by energy generated on the
              mobile work equipment itself, for example, by an internal
              combustion engine or through connection to a remote power source,
              such as an electric cable, electric induction or hydraulic line.

                Work equipment which may be mounted on self-propelled mobile
                work equipment to alter its characteristics, for example, a fork
                lift truck load rotator alters the load-handling capabilities

                Attachments are not considered to be mobile work equipment in
                their own right, but if they can affect the safety of the
                self-propelled mobile work equipment when they are attached,
                they are considered to be part of the self-propelled work
                equipment.

              Attachments may be non-powered, powered by an independent power
              source, or powered by the self-propelled work equipment to which
              they are attached.
