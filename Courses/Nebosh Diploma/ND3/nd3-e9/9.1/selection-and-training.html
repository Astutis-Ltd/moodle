      truck specific.

    <p>
      Following satisfactory completion of training, employees should be given
      written authorisation by their employers to operate the type(s) of truck
      which the employer considers they are competent to operate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Authorisations may be issued on an individual basis and / or recorded
      centrally by employers. Employers will also need to ensure that they are
      satisfied with the continuing competence of authorised operators.
