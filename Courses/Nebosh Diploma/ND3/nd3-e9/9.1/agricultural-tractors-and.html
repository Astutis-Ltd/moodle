      A tractor can overturn anywhere - on silage clamps, near field drains and
      even on the flat. Most overturns happen on slopes because drivers misjudge
      slopes, ignore changing ground conditions and forget the effect of loads
      on stability
    </p>
    <p>The main issues affecting stability are:</p>

    <p>
      Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV) is a generic term that encompasses all
      transport systems capable of functioning without driver operation. The
      systems are used primarily in manufacturing and distribution settings and
      have been available since the 1950s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early systems used detectors on the AGV to follow a buried electrical
      circuit or a magnetic guide tape laid on the floor surface. These systems
      are becoming obsolete and most modern systems use varying degrees of
      computer programming to give instructions to the AGVs and use laser
      triangulation for navigation. A rotating laser, complete with a sender
      (source) and receiver (detector) is mounted on each AGV. It strobes the
      surroundings and receives feedback from reflectors mounted on walls,
      columns and equipment, which is used to calculate the vehicle’s exact
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern AGV designs tend to be based on a standard vehicle platform which
      can be customised to meet any automated material handling requirements.
