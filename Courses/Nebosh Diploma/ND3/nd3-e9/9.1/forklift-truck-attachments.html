    <p>
      Fitting an attachment may alter the characteristics of the lift truck and
      is likely to necessitate a reduction in the actual capacity of the lift
      truck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attachments may be mounted on the fork arms, or directly onto the
      carriage. In all cases the attachment should be securely fastened, and
      care taken to ensure that the attachment or securing device does not foul
      any part of the mast structure during raising or lowering of the
      attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main types of attachment are shown in the image and described in the
      table below.
    </p>

                A hydraulically operated attachment which allows the operator,
                while remaining in the operating position, to change the
                position of the fork arms relative to each other.

              Some rotators have the facility to tilt the load forward from the
