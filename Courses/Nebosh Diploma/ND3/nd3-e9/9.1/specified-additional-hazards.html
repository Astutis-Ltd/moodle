      <p>Overrun of speed</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Overrunning typically occurs when vehicles are driving down steep slopes,
      and gravity and momentum exert a greater influence than the vehicle’s
      accelerator. Ground conditions and the condition of the vehicle may render
      braking ineffective, and a loss of control of the vehicle could result.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Overheating</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Overheating can occur due to friction on overworked bearings or brakes, or
      overworked electric motors, or failures of thermostats and other parts of
      cooling systems. The hot surfaces can present an ignition risk in
      flammable atmospheres and can burn people on contact.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Contact with wheels and tracks</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Where there is a foreseeable risk of contact with wheels or tracks when
      mobile equipment is travelling, people must be kept away from the moving
      parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be achieved by the positioning of cabs, operator stations and
      work platforms, and the fitting of suitable barriers, such as robust guard
      rails or fenders, in positions which prevent the wheels and tracks being
      reached.
    </p>

        Contact with other moving parts, drive shafts, Power Take-Off (PTO)
        shafts, etc.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Appropriate safeguards, in accordance with the requirements of Regulation
      11 of PUWER, should be provided to prevent people from coming into contact
      with the dangerous moving parts of mobile work equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drive shafts are the means of transferring power from the vehicle’s engine
      to any powered attachments. On an agricultural tractor this is typically
      referred to as a Power Take-Off (PTO) shaft. Tractor Power Take-Off (PTO)
      and the power take-off drive shaft of a machine are very dangerous if not
      correctly guarded. Every year people are killed or seriously injured and
      most of the accidents were preventable if the PTO and PTO drive shaft had
      been fitted with guards of good design, which were properly used and
      maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tractor PTO should be protected with a shield covering the top and
      both sides of the PTO, so that it stops anyone making contact with it. The
      shield must be well constructed and capable of supporting a downward load
      of at least 120kg. When not in use the PTO may be covered by a fixed cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      PTO drive shafts should be guarded by enclosing them along their full
      length, from the tractor to the first bearing on the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advice on guard dimensions and design specifications for agricultural PTO
      drive shaft guards are contained in BS EN 12965:2003+A2:2009 Tractors and
      machinery for agriculture and forestry. Power Take-Off (PTO) drive shafts
      and their guards. Safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Criteria for wear and strength tests for guards are in BS EN ISO 5674:2009
      Tractors and machinery for agriculture and forestry. Guards for Power
      Take-Off (PTO) drive-shafts. Strength and wear tests and acceptance
      criteria.
