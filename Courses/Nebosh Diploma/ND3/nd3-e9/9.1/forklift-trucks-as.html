    <p>
      People should never be lifted on the fork arms of a lift truck, or a
      pallet balanced on the fork arms of a lift truck because they can easily
      fall off.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when fitted with a suitably designed working platform they can
      provide a safer alternative to other means of access (such as a ladder),
      although it will not provide the same level of safety as purpose-built
      equipment, such as a Mobile Elevated Work Platform (MEWP) (see Section
      7.3).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is generally accepted that an integrated working platform provides a
      higher level of safety than a non-integrated type.
    </p>
    <p>
      An integrated working platform has controls that are linked to and isolate
      the truck controls, so that only a person in the platform can control the
      lift height of the platform and truck movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      A non-integrated working platform has no controls in the platform. All
      truck and working platform movements are controlled by the truck operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      A permissioning control working platforms is a non-integrated working
      platform with hold-to-run controls that link to and nullify the truck lift
      / lower and traction controls, until the controls in the platform are
      actuated by a person in the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: If used for lifting people the fork lift truck will need to be
      thoroughly examined by a competent person at least once every six months
      or in accordance with an examination scheme, and each time that
      exceptional circumstances which are liable to jeopardise the safety of the
      lifting equipment have occurred.

        The Work at Height Regulations 2005, Regulation 7(2)</span
      >(b) places a duty on employers to select the most suitable work equipment
      for the task to be carried out, regardless of the duration of the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the UK in exceptional circumstances relating to short duration,
      occasional use (such as unplanned, reactive inspections of racking or
      overhead light fittings) the use of non-integrated working platforms with
      fork lift trucks is allowed, in accordance with guidance note PM28.
    </p>
    <p>
      This may not be allowed in some other EU member states. Consequently there
      is NO free movement of non-integrated working platforms throughout the EU
      and they MUST NOT be CE marked.
