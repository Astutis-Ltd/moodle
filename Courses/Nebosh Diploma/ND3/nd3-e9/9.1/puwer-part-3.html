    <p>
      Where there is a risk to an employee riding on mobile work equipment from
      its rolling over, it must be minimised by:
    </p>

    <!--Astutis List Alphabet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">

    <p>Suitable restraining systems must also be provided.</p>
    <p>
      Compliance with this regulation is not required where it would increase
      the overall risk to safety, or it would not be reasonably practicable to
      operate the mobile work equipment in consequence.

      <p>Regulation 27: Overturning of fork lift trucks</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Fork Lift Trucks (FLT) which carry employees must be adapted or equipped
      to reduce, to as low as is reasonably practicable, the risk to safety from
      its overturning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mast of a vertical-masted FLT will generally prevent a FLT overturning
      more than 90 degrees. A variable reach truck FLT capable of rolling over
      180 degrees or more, which is used where there is a risk of it rolling
      over, would need a Roll-Over Protective Structure (ROPS) which should be
      provided where appropriate.

      <p>Regulation 29: Remote-controlled self-propelled work equipment</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Where remote-controlled self-propelled work equipment involves a risk to
      safety while in motion it must be designed and constructed to ensure it
      stops automatically once it leaves its control range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there is a risk of crushing or impact it must incorporate features
      to guard against such risk (for example, motion sensor trip devices).

      <p>Regulation 30: Drive shafts</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Where the seizure of the drive shaft between mobile work equipment and its
      accessories, or anything towed, is likely to involve a risk to safety,
      every employer should ensure that the work equipment has a means of
      preventing such seizure. If seizure is unavoidable, they should take every
      possible measure to avoid an adverse effect on the safety of an employee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where mobile work equipment has a shaft for the transmission of energy
      between it and other mobile work equipment, and the shaft could become
      soiled or damaged by contact with the ground while uncoupled, the work
      equipment must have a system for safeguarding the shaft.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ‘drive shaft’ is a device, which conveys the power from the mobile work
      equipment to any work equipment connected to it. In agriculture these are
      known as power take-off shafts.
