    <p>
      Lift trucks are widely used throughout industry for moving materials and
      goods, but they also feature prominently in worksite accidents. Every year
      there are about 8 000 lift truck accidents resulting in injury. On
      average, ten of them are fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many different designs of lift truck, with fork or other
      attachments, which have a range of uses in different industrial sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section describes some of the main types of industrial lift truck,
      and a range of attachments.

    <p>
      The counterbalance is a counterweight to the rear of the truck which
      balances the load on the fork arms, which project out from the front of
      the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loads can be raised or lowered vertically and the mast will typically be
      able to be tilted forwards or backwards by about 5&deg;.
    </p>
    <p>
      This type of lift truck is only suitable for use on substantially firm,
      smooth, level and prepared surfaces, such as a warehouse yard. A wide
      range of attachments are available.
    </p>

      <p>Industrial reach truck</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The reach truck mast moves forwards or reaches out to pick up the load.
      When travelling, the load is reached back and carried within the
      wheelbase.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reach truck has greater manoeuvrability than the industrial
      counterbalance truck and is used in areas where space is restricted, such
      as the aisles of a warehouse. It is only suitable for use on substantially
      firm, smooth, level and prepared surfaces.

        <p>
          The rough-terrain counterbalance lift truck is similar in design to
          the industrial counterbalance lift truck but with larger wheels and
          pneumatic tyres, giving it greater ground clearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is therefore more able to operate on uneven and soft ground and is
          mainly used in the construction industry and in agriculture. It may be
          used with a range of attachments.
