      Toxicity tests determine the dose or concentration response relationship
      of the tested substance. The relationship is theoretically (though rarely
      in practise) a Gaussian curve.

      LD<sub>50</sub> is the abbreviation used for the dose which kills 50% of
      the test population. LD<sub>50</sub> is expressed in milligrams per
      kilogram of body weight of the test animal (which must be mentioned).
    </p>
    <p>
      LC<sub>50</sub> is the abbreviation used for the exposure concentration of
      a toxic substance lethal to half of the test animals. LC<sub>50</sub> is
      expressed in millilitres per kilogram of body weight of the test animal
      (which must be mentioned), exposed to the substance by inhalation during a
      specified period.
    </p>
    <p>
      For different substances the doses needed to produce an adverse effect
      varies widely. LD<sub>50</sub> values are used to compare acute toxicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assessment of the effects is tested in laboratories using animals,
      mainly rats, mice and rabbits. The test substance or preparation may be
      applied to the animal orally, under the skin, by inhalation, into the
      abdomen or into the vein.
    </p>
    <p>
      LD<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>50</sub> are the parameters used to quantify
      the results of different tests so that they may be compared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Classification may be based on the LD<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>50</sub>
      values.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following list describes the variation in LD<sub>50</sub> values
      measured in ingestion studies of some substances on the rat:

    <p>
      It is important to mention the species on which the test was conducted
      because the numerical values of LD<sup>50</sup> and LC<sub>50</sub> depend
      on several factors, such as the biological system or animal, strain, sex,
      age and diet. The LD<sub>50</sub> of DDT insecticide administered orally
      is 87mg / kg of body weight for a rat but 150mg / kg of body weight for a
      dog. The LD<sub>50</sub> for dioxin is 0.02mg / kg of body weight for a
      rat and 0.001mg / kg of body weight for a dog, i.e. the rat is twenty
      times more tolerant to dioxin than the dog.

      The assessment of how a human system would react is not a straight forward
      estimation from the animal tests. However, the animal tests give an idea
      of the level of the toxic effects.

      The other key reference points on the exposure-response curve are the:

    <p>
      The NOAEL is the highest point on the exposure-response curve at which no
      adverse health effects are observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The LOAEL is the lowest point on the exposure-response curve at which
      adverse health effects are observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept of NOAEL / LOAEL is of practical relevance in the WEL setting
      context (<span class="ast-bold" style="color: orange">Element B4</span>).
