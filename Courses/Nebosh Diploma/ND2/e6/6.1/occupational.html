      An estimated two million people every year in the UK alone complain of
      ill-health which is caused or aggravated by work. Epidemiology has an
      important role notably in:

    <p>
      Epidemiological studies can be classed as observational or experimental.
      The gold standard of experimental design is the randomised control trial
      (or clinical trial) which is used to determine the effectiveness of
      medical treatments, drugs and vaccines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away from experimental studies and out in the real world observational
      analytical studies are undertaken as natural public health experiments -
      observing populations and letting nature take its course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two types of observational analytical studies are specified in the NEBOSH
      Diploma syllabus: the cohort study and the case-control study. Both are
      natural experiments and therefore are less controlled than a randomised
      control trial, but both provide truly quantitative risk evaluation. The
      cohort design is better because it follows the natural timeline of
      suspected cause preceding effect.

    <p>
      A ‘cohort’ was strictly speaking a fighting unit of the Roman army
      (roughly comparable to a ‘battalion’ nowadays). The term is now applied
      epidemiologically to a clearly defined population who prospectively share
      a common experience such as an occupational exposure. Comparisons in the
      incidence of ill-health (morbidity), or death (mortality) can be made
      between exposed and non-exposed cohorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cohort studies provide the best information about the causation of disease
      and the most direct measurement of the risk of developing disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study begins with a group of people free of disease (or outcome of
      concern). The group is sub-classified according to exposure to a suspected
      cause (e.g. smokers and non-smokers) and followed over time to determine
      the development of new cases of disease (e.g. lung cancer) in each group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="ast-bold">incidence rate</span> (number of new cases
      divided by population exposed) of disease in both groups can be calculated
      and the <span class="ast-bold">Relative Risk (RR)</span> of disease in the
      exposed group compared to the non-exposed group can be determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      A relative risk of 3 - 4 (i.e. the exposed group is 3 to 4 times more
      likely to develop the disease of concern, than the non-exposed group) is
      considered to be a good indication of a causal relationship between cause
      and effect, although on its own is no guarantee of a causal relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cohort studies may be conducted
      <span class="ast-bold">prospectively</span> which means they start in the
      present and track exposures and outcomes into the future. This poses
      ethical problems as if a cause and effect relationship is suspected an
      immediate intervention is the appropriate course of action. This would
      protect individuals but would ruin the natural experiment so that no
      meaningful data would be generated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cohort studies are often conducted
      <span class="ast-bold">retrospectively</span> using historical data. The
      study is conducted in exactly the same way but the starting point is some
      time in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early 1950s Doll and Hill studied a population of approximately 40
      000 British GPs, who replied to a simple questionnaire on their smoking
      habits; and were divided into non-smokers and three groups of smokers
      (including ex-smokers) according to the amount smoked. The resulting
      mortality rates revealed a significant and steadily rising risk of death
      from lung cancer as the amount of tobacco smoked increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more recent workplace study showed that those categories of workers with
      a high cumulative exposure to benzene had a higher mortality rate from
      certain types of leukaemia than groups of workers with no, or lower
      exposures.

      <p>Case control studies</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      A case control study starts with a population of individuals with the
      disease under investigation (Cases) and compares them with a carefully
      matched control group of individuals without the disease (Controls).
    </p>
    <p>
      The past histories of both groups is established to determine exposure to
      suspected causal agents and the groups are sub-classified into exposed and
      non-exposed groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the study is not based upon a known proportion of the population,
      incidence rates cannot be calculated and risk cannot be directly
      calculated either.
    </p>
    <p>
      The odds of each group having been exposed to suspected causal agents can
      be calculated and then the Odds Ratio (OR) which is the ratio of odds of
      exposure amongst the cases to the odds of exposure amongst the controls
      can be calculated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data for case-control studies is likely to present itself from health
      screening / surveillance activities. An evaluation of historical data is
      again termed a retrospective study.

          A food poisoning outbreak at a party provides a practical example of a
          case-control study. Of a hundred guests 60 developed food poisoning.
          These are the cases and the 40 who did not get food poisoning are the
          controls. The range of foods at the buffet are the suspected causal
          agents and by interviewing each guest (cases and controls) the odds of
          each group having consumed each food type can be calculated and the
          Odds Ratio might show that those who suffered food poisoning (cases)
          were four times more likely to have ate the chicken drumsticks, for
          example, than those who did not get food poisoning (controls).

          In an occupational context a study showed that patients with
          adenocarcoma nasal cancer (cases) had a disproportionately greater
          likelihood of having worked in the hardwood industry, when compared to
          referent patients (controls) with other pathology.
