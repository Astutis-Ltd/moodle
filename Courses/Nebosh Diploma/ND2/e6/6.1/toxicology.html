      Toxicology is the science of adverse effects of chemical substances on
      living organisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no ‘safe’ substances, all chemicals can be poisonous and cause
      injury or death. But they can be used safely: the effect depends on the
      dose and exposure. It is possible by limiting these to handle and benefit
      from the properties of chemical substances in an ‘acceptably safe’ way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toxicological studies aim to assess the adverse effects related to
      different doses in order to find this ‘acceptably safe’ level.
    </p>
    <p>The work is carried out in two phases:</p>

      This information is obtained from laboratory tests with cells, bacteria,

      Large amounts of toxicological information have been collected into
      databases and data banks.

      Article 13 of REACH specifies the general requirements for generation of
      information on the intrinsic properties of substances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information may be generated by means other than tests, provided that the
      conditions set out in Annex XI (the general rules for adaptation of the
      standard testing regime) are met.
    </p>
    <p>
      Human toxicity information should be generated whenever possible by means
      other than vertebrate animal tests, for example:

    <p>
      REACH requires that the methods are regularly reviewed and improved with a
      view to reducing testing on vertebrate animals and the number of animals
      involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where tests on substances are required to generate information on
      intrinsic properties of substances, they shall be conducted in accordance
      with the test methods laid down in a Commission Regulation or in
      accordance with other international test methods recognised by the
      Commission or the Agency as being appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eco-toxicological and toxicological tests and analyses are to be carried
      out in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apparent conflict between REACH objectives for generating information
      on the intrinsic properties of substances whilst reducing the amount of
      animal testing is partially addressed through the mandatory sharing of
      animal test data. The data-sharing mechanisms are:
