      Lethality has been the primary toxicological endpoint in acute toxicity
      tests since the 1920s, when Trevan first attempted to standardise a method
      for assessing the toxicity of biological agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      From then the acute toxicity test in rodents has been seen by many as an
      essential step in determining the toxicity of a test material for the
      purpose of hazard classification and labelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The classical LD50 test procedure which estimates the dose level that is
      expected to kill 50% of the test population was developed in the 1970s and
      early 1980s, and used between 100 and 200 animals to test a substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The LD50 test procedure has been criticised since its creation for both
      scientific (challenging the validity of animal tests in determining
      toxicity for humans) and animal welfare grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      These criticisms led to the adoption of a new guideline (OECD TG401) in
      1987 that reduced the required number of test animals to 20 and became the
      most widely used method for defining the acute toxicity of a chemical and
      a mandatory-testing requirement for new chemicals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The acute toxicity test procedure has been further modified over recent
      years and the number of animals required has been reduced to a maximum of
      16.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of acute toxicity data is mainly to label and classify chemicals
      based on their toxicity, for application to the human situation, however
      as mentioned there have been numerous challenges to the approach, on a
      range of grounds including:

      <p>Acute toxicity methods</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      There are many approved approaches for acute toxicity testing of
      substances that may be ingested, inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally small groups of animals are dosed in a stepwise procedure with
      fixed doses of 5, 50, 500 and 2 000mg / kg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial dose level is selected on the basis of a sighting study as the
      dose expected to produce some signs of toxicity without causing severe
      toxic effects or mortality. Further groups of animals may be dosed at
      higher or lower fixed doses, depending on the presence or absence of signs
      of toxicity or mortality. This procedure continues until the dose causing
      evident toxicity or no more than one death is identified, or when no
      effects are seen at the highest dose or when deaths occur at the lowest
      dose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study outcome is categorisation according to the GHS Acute Toxicity
      scheme. Category 1 is the most severe toxicity category. Category 5 is for
      chemicals which are of relatively low acute toxicity but which, under
      certain circumstances, may pose a hazard to vulnerable populations.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Chronic toxicity testing</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Chronic toxicity testing is undertaken over a major portion of the test
      animalsâ€™ life span. Doses are administered daily and daily observations
      are undertaken to detect the earliest signs of toxicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Test groups are larger than for acute toxicity tests. For rodents at least
      40 animals (20 female and 20 male) are used at each dose level for both
      the test group and the concurrent control group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two main routes of administration are oral and inhalation. The choice
      of the route of administration depends upon the physical and chemical
      characteristics of the test substance and the likely route of exposure in
      humans.
