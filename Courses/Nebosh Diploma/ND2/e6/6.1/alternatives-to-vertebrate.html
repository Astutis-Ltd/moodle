          The Ames test is a biological assay for assessing the mutagenic
          potential of chemical compounds. It was developed by Bruce Ames in
          1973.
        </p>
        <p>
          The test uses a strain of
          <span class="ast-italic">Salmonella typhimurium</span> that carries a
          defective (mutant) gene making it unable to synthesize the amino acid
          histidine (His) from the ingredients in its culture medium.

              substance in a product.

    <p>
      The altered <span class="ast-italic">Salmonella</span> strains are
      combined in a test tube with the chemical of interest and animal liver
      enzymes which detect what might happen if the chemical entered a human
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="ast-italic">Salmonella</span> are then transferred to a
      petri dish to grow for one or two days. The altered
      <span class="ast-italic">Salmonella</span> used for the test require the
      amino acid histidine to grow, and a positive result in the test indicates
      that the test substance has induced a back mutation in the
      <span class="ast-italic">Salmonella</span> meaning it no longer requires
      histidine to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the test was developed, it was thought that most of the chemicals
      that produce results in the Ames test could also cause cancer. It was
      hoped that this simple test would be an easy way to find cancer-causing
      chemicals.

    <p>
      Over time, the test was found to be a less reliable predictor of
      carcinogenesis than had been hoped. Some substances that cause cancer in
      laboratory animals (for example: dioxin) do not give a positive Ames test
      and other substances will give false positive results.
    </p>
    <p>The Ames test is still considered useful because it:</p>
