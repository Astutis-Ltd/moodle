    <p>
      Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR) are mathematical,
      computer based, models which are designed to predict the physico-chemical
      properties, human health and environmental effects of a substance from
      knowledge of its chemical structure (molecular descriptors). Some QSAR
      models are qualitative rather than quantitative and give an indication of
      a likely effect rather than try to quantify that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      QSAR methods have the potential to provide information on hazards of
      chemicals, while reducing time, monetary cost and animal testing currently
      needed. To facilitate the practical application of QSAR approaches in
      regulatory contexts the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
      Development (OECD) is conducting its QSAR Project with the financial
      assistance of the EU. A QSAR toolbox is downloadable from the OECD
      website.

      CAESAR was an EC funded project (Project no. 022674 – SSPI), which was
      specifically dedicated to develop QSAR models for the REACH legislation.
    </p>
    <p>CAESAR developed statistical models for the following five endpoints:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">Bio-concentration factor (BCF)</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">Skin sensitisation</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">Carcinogenicity</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">Mutagenicity</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">Developmental toxicity.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The models were assessed according to the OECD principles for the
      validation of QSAR, using a series of statistical checks and field tests,
      to verify that the models performs correctly on new compounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CAESAR software was later migrated to a new online platform called
      VEGA.

    <p>
      Read across’ is a technique of filling data gaps. To ‘read across’ is to
      apply data from a tested chemical for a particular property or effect
      (cancer, reproductive toxicity, etc.) to a similar untested chemical. The
      read across technique is often applied within groups of similar chemicals
      assembled for assessment using either analogue approach (grouping based on
      a very limited number of chemicals) or category approach (grouping based
      on a larger number of chemicals). In an analogue / category approach, not
      every chemical needs to be tested for every endpoint.
