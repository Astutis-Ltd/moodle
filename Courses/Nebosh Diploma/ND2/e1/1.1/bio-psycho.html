      In 1977 George Engel critiqued the prevailing reductionist biomedical
      model of medicine that suggests every disease process can be explained in
      terms of an underlying deviation from normal function, such as a pathogen,
      genetic or developmental abnormality, or injury. He proposed a new
      holistic alternative â€“ the bio-psychosocial model.

    <p>In his critique of the biomedical model Engel noted that:</p>

          Biochemical alterations do not necessarily translate directly into an
          illness and psychological alteration may, under certain circumstances,
          manifest as illnesses

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Psychosocial variables are more important determinants of
          susceptibility, severity, and illness than had been previously
          appreciated

          The success of the most biological of treatments is influenced by

          Patients are profoundly influenced by the way in which they are

      Engel believed that to work effectively with patients, clinicians should
      attend simultaneously to the biological, psychological, and social
      dimensions of illness. Engel did not deny that the mainstream of
      biomedical research had fostered important advances in medicine, but
      believed that a fundamental shift was necessary to reverse the
      de-humanisation of medicine, and to empower patients.
