    <p>
      In complex organisations with a spectrum of occupational health hazards a
      multi-faceted team of professionals may be required to help manage the
      risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key professionals are likely to be an occupational physician and
      occupational health nurse / adviser. Other professionals who may have a
      key role to play include:

      Occupational hygienists may also work within the team, although as
      discussed in Element B4 occupational hygiene is a distinct profession with
      a more proactive role in the measurement and evaluation of occupational
      health risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occupational health services are often contracted out to specialist
      service providers.
