    <p>
      Prevention literally means to stop something from happening. Historically,
      the public health concept of disease prevention has viewed prevention as
      primary (prevents the disease itself), secondary (addresses the severity
      of the disease) or tertiary (manages the associated disability).
    </p>
    <p>
      The WHO (2001) acknowledged the difficulties in applying this framework to
      mental ill-health due to the range of environmental and genetic factors at
      specific periods of life that may lead to the development and
      identification of a mental illness, disorder or ill-health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, once a disorder has developed, it is still possible to reduce
      its severity, duration, and associated disability by taking preventive
      measures throughout its course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following framework (see table below) is advocated for prevention of
      mental ill-health.
