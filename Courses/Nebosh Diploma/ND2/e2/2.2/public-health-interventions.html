    <p>
      Health and wellbeing as experienced and observed in the workplace, is the
      product of two major forces:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          What employees bring with them to the workplace in terms of personal
          resources, health practices, beliefs, attitudes, values, and genetics
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The physical and psycho-social impacts that work at the workplace has
          on the employees.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      In addition to directly impacting upon an individual’s health, work can
      also make it difficult for employees to take care for their own health
      through excessive demands on time and energy through long work hours,
      trave time, overtime etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until relatively recently most research was around personal health
      practises with the employer facilitating healthy lifestyle choices through
      subsidised gym memberships and fruit baskets etc (the ‘bikes and bananas’
      approach).
    </p>
    <p>
      As discussed earlier ‘wellbeing’ is a much broader church than
      occupational health and requires a lot more organisational input than just
      facilitating healthy lifestyle choices around smoking cessation, alcohol
      reduction, healthier diets and increased exercise levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The workplace provides an enormous opportunity for public health / health
      promotion initiatives to help improve the health of the working population
      because of the relatively unfettered access to a stable working population
      with established communication systems and social networks and the
      associated opportunities of positive peer pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Efforts can be delivered to the whole workforce, smaller interest groups
      or individuals as shown in the table below.

    <p>
      To be effective the right interventions need to be focused on the right
      people at the right time, and worker engagement and participation is key
      to the success of any workplace initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some organisations (e.g. the NHS) appoint
      <span class="ast-bold">‘health and wellbeing champions’</span>
      as a means of distributed leadership for health and wellbeing initiatives.
      These are people from any level of the organisation who are keen to
      promote, identify, and signpost ways to support the wellbeing of their
      colleagues. Familiarity with their work areas and colleagues, means they
      are well placed to recognise what may work best in their particular work
      environment, and to make suggestions regarding appropriate interventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with any other workplace initiative or intervention it is important
      that the impact is fully understood through regular review of appropriate
      performance indicators such as absentee rates and referrals to support
      services etc. Successes need to be shared and celebrated with the
      workforce through effective communication and lessons should be learned
      from interventions that were not effective / less effective than expect so
      that the challenges can be understood and hopefully overcome next time
      around.
