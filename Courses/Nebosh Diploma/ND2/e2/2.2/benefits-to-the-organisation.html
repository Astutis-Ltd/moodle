      Dissatisfaction with work and job-related stress are two of the main
      causes of mental and physical ill-health in the UK. Happy workers are 20%
      more productive, 34% less likely to leave their jobs and 37% less likely
      to take time off sick. (Mind, 2020)

      In 2013 BITC / Workwell research showed that FTSE 100 companies that
      prioritised employee engagement and wellbeing outperformed the rest of the

      loyalty, commitment, innovation, productivity and profitability.

      <span class="ast-italic"> “happy, healthy and here”. </span> The HSE also
      recognised that the major challenge for improving occupational health and
      safety the UK lies in improving occupational health which is less amenable
      to regulation than occupational safety.
