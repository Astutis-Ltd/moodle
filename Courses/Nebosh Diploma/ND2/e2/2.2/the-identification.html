    <p>
      The HSE’s Management Standards approach to tackling work-related stress
      establishes a framework to help employers tackle work-related stress and,
      as a result, also reduce the incidence and negative impact of mental ill
      health.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several different types of information or data that can be used
      to help identify, in broad terms, whether work-related stress and mental
      ill-health are potential problems in the workplace including:

                A walk-through is where a manager walks through a section and
                observes work processes to assess whether there are any obvious
                aspects of the job which may cause excessive pressure.
              </p>

              A talk-through involves someone describing what happens when a
              task is being carried out. It can offer staff an opportunity to
              think about tasks in terms of the potential they have to lead to
              work-related stress.

    <p>
      Surveys can be a useful source of information on whether work-related
      stress is a potential problem for the workforce and, if so, who is likely
      to be affected and how.
    </p>
    <p>
      The validity of self-report and questionnaire-based surveys is often
      called into question because they are dependent on how people ‘feel’ about
      issues. However, evidence suggests that individual perceptions play an
      important role in predicting stress-related ill health.

              The Management Standards approach suggests that focus groups are
              used as to evaluate the risk by exploring problems and developing
              solutions, although smaller organisations may find it more useful
              to use such group approaches during the earlier stages of the risk
              assessment process.
