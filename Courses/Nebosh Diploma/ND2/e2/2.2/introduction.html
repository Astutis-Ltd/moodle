      The majority of people with mental health problems are capable of
      continuing to work productively. Evidence shows that employment can be of
      great benefit, both to the employer and to the employee.

    <p>
      Mental health problems may meet the definition of ‘disability’ in which
      case the employer would be required to make reasonable adjustments to
      prevent disabled employees from being disadvantaged at work. Examples of
      reasonable adjustments or more general accommodations might include:

      Depending on the scale and maturity of an organisation there are a number
      of departments and professional groups that could have responsibility,
      for, or an interest in mental-health in the workplace, notably
      occupational health and safety, occupational health, human resources or
      employee assistance programmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The involvements, responsibilities and inter-relationships of the various
      parties need to be understood and coordinated to ensure it is
      straightforward for a concerned colleague to get the necessary advice and
      support.
