    <p>
      As soon as a line manager notices, or is made aware that a colleague is
      experiencing mental ill-health an early conversation is called for to
      determine what the issues are and what support may be available. If the
      colleague is unwilling to discuss concerns with their line manager a
      referral to occupational health services, an employee assistance programme
      or HR may be appropriate.

    <p>
      Where a colleague is clearly emotionally distressed it is particularly
      important that the manager remains calm and collected. If the distress
      arises in a work meeting it might be appropriate to ask the colleague if
      they would like someone else to accompany them. Otherwise a calm
      conversation in a quiet place to determine whether they wish to go home,
      or need you to contact a family member, their GP, or someone in their
      health support team.
    </p>
    <p>
      If someone is experiencing hallucinations or mania, they may need
      immediate medical help. If an employee is disturbing others and refuses to
      accept help, advice should be sought from the occupational health
      provider, the person’s GP or the NHS via 111 or 999 in an emergency.

    <p>
      Colleagues with ongoing mental health problems should be treated in
      exactly the same way as any other member of staff, unless they ask for
      help or demonstrate clear signs that they need it. It is discriminatory to
      make assumptions about people’s capabilities, their promotability or the
      amount of sick leave they may need because of their illness.

      <p>Coping strategies</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Most people are encouraged to develop a coping strategy as part of their
      care. This often involves noting signs of a possible relapse and taking
      pre-emptive action, such as cutting down on work, being careful about
      drinking alcohol, taking exercise and finding time to relax. It is
      important to support the employee at this first warning stage. Small,
      inexpensive adjustments may well prevent a more costly period of illness.

    <p>
      Some people find it useful to draw up an ‘advance statement’ which
      explains how they want to be treated if they become unwell. The statement
      can cover practical arrangements such as details of the people who need to
      be contacted or provided with information. If an employee draws up an
      agreement it should be put into practice to maintain trust.
