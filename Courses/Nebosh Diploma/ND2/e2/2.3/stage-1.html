    <p>
      Finding out whether or not violence in the workplace is a problem is not
      always easy, as staff can hide their concerns. Effective consultation,
      taking on board the views of staff who deal with the public and have
      first-hand knowledge and experience of actual or potential workplace
      violence, is essential in establishing the true scale of the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information from near miss incidents, where no-one was actually hurt in
      spite of the potential for harm, can be useful in preventing future, more
      serious occurrences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial investigation should cover all violent incidents from minor
      verbal abuse to serious physical injury where staff have felt threatened
      or experienced undue stress.

          The relationships between the outcomes should present as the accident
          triangles discussed in Unit 1, Element 5. The numbers and
          sub-categories will vary, but essentially a percentage of verbal abuse
          incidents will escalate to physical violence, and a smaller percentage
          may involve weapons and could ultimately be fatal.

      Formal procedures for reporting incidents and collecting and analysing
      data will help to establish whether there is a pattern of incidents, and
      identify particular targets or practices at risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reporting systems and forms should be clear and easy to follow, and staff
      should be encouraged to report confidentially any incident which causes
      them harm or concern.

      Cases of workplace violence may be categorised in various ways. Table 2.10
      identifies three categories of work related violence, and a fourth
      category which is not directly work-related but can occur in the
      workplace.

    <p>
      Beyond personal characteristics that may make an individual more or less
      likely to be violent or aggressive, research has identified a huge number
      of triggers and escalators (or accelerators) of violence and aggression
      which often work in combinations to agitate an individual and trigger an
      aggressive or violent response (see image below). These triggers and
      escalators will vary greatly between workplaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of triggers and escalators in a high-school classroom and a NHS
      Accident and Emergency waiting room are shown in the table below.

          The risk of being a victim of actual or threatened violence at work is

          violent incidents at work.

          An estimated 307 000 adults of working age in employment experienced

    <p>
      The CSEW shows that there is large variation in the risks at work across
      occupational groups. Overall, respondents in protective service
      occupations, such as police officers, were at greatest risk of assaults
      and threats while working at 8.4% (6x the average risk of 1.4% across all
      occupations).
    </p>
    <p>
      Health and social care associate professionals and health professionals
      have a risk of around 2.5x the national average at 3.9% and 3.3%
      respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Managers and proprietors of public houses, off-licenses etc also had an
      increased risk at 2.9%.
