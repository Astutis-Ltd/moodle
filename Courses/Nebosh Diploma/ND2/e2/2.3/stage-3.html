    <p>
      The organisation’s policy for dealing with violence may be written into
      the health and safety policy statement, so that all employees are aware of
      it. This will help employees to co-operate with you, follow procedures
      properly and report any further incidents.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Violence policy</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      In any workplace with a problem with violence it will be appropriate to
      devise and communicate a specific policy addressing workplace violence. A
      clear zero tolerance policy that is strongly communicated has been seen to
      have a positive impact in workplaces such as airport security check areas,
      NHS A&E waiting rooms and pubs and clubs.
    </p>
    <p>An example of such a statement would be:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">
        “Management supports this policy and will not tolerate any instances of
        work-related violence, including verbal abuse, to our staff.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">
        No member of staff will be blamed for an instance of work-related
        violence caused by a customer or member of the public.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">
        All employees have the right to be treated with consideration, dignity
        and respect.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>The policy should also include:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Detailed responsibilities of managers and staff;
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Procedures for dealing with an incident;
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Procedures for recording and reporting the details of an incident;
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">Control measures in place; and</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Arrangements for post-incident support.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Appropriate control measures should be devised, introduced and monitored
      to assure ongoing effectiveness.
    </p>
