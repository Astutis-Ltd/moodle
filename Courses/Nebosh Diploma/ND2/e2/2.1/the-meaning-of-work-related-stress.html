    <p>
      In engineering terms, when a force (pressure) is applied to a structural
      component stress (expressed as units of force per unit area) is created
      within the material, giving rise to a deformation called strain. When the
      force applied exceeds the materials capacity to take the strain it will
      break.

    <p>
      People are no different. Each individual has the capacity to cope with a
      certain amount of pressure, beyond this limit (or ability to take the
      strain) the individual will ‘break’ and suffer psychological harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many models illustrating how workplace pressure affects workers.
      None are specified on the NEBOSH Diploma syllabus. We are going to look
      briefly at:

        <p>
          The ‘bucket theory’ models human beings as buckets. Each person’s
          bucket has a different capacity representing their ability to cope
          with pressure.
        </p>
        <p>Pressure may pour into the bucket in different ways:</p>

        <p>
          Each ‘bucket’ also has pressure relief arrangements to prevent it
          overflowing, such as coping mechanisms, social activities, holidays
          etc.

    <p>
      When the bucket is not large enough to cope with the pressures poured into
      it, it overflows indicating stress related illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this model, if a person’s bucket is largely full from domestic
      pressure, it can literally be a drop of additional workplace pressure that
      causes their bucket to overflow.

    <p>
      Psychologists Robert Yerkes and John Dodson claimed there was an empirical
      relationship between arousal and performance, as long ago as 1908. The
      ‘Yerkes-Dodson Law’ asserts that performance increases with physiological
      or mental arousal (stimulation / pressure) up to a point, but when levels
      of arousal become too high, performance decreases.

    <p>
      More recent research (Lupien et al 2007) into the effects of stress and
      stress hormones on human cognition showed the relationship between human
      memory performance and circulating levels of glucocorticoids (stress
      hormones) as an upside down U shaped curve, which the authors noted
      resembled the Yerkes–Dodson curve.

      The HSE recognises that a degree of stimulation or pressure in the
      workplace is beneficial, but that excessive pressure can result in stress
      related ill-health. The HSE has defined stress as:
