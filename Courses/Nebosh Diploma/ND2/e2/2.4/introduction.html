      Lone workers face the same hazards at work as anyone else, but there is a
      greater risk of these hazards causing harm as they may not have anyone to
      help or support them if things go wrong.

      <p>Changing ways of working</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Ways of working are changing with automation and greater use of
      technology. Types of workers are also changing, for example people are
      working until they are older. This means employers need to think
      differently when considering how to keep them healthy and safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gig economy is also increasing and features short-term, informal
      working relationships where work is generally:

    <p>
      These workers are usually independent contractors, freelancers or
      self-employed. Many are lone workers, working to deadlines and exposed to
      specific road risks for work-related journeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally, lone HGV drivers are likely to experience long, unsociable hours,
      high physical and mental demands, and often long periods of sedentary
      work. Employers should monitor drivers’ health regularly and adapt their
      work to accommodate any individual health needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these factors can have adverse health consequences for workers,
      such as musculoskeletal disorders, stress, tiredness and fatigue, as well
      as issues associated with poor or irregular eating habits.

      <p>Stress, mental health and wellbeing</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Lone working can negatively impact on employees’ work-related stress
      levels and their mental health.
    </p>
    <p>
      As discussed earlier, the Stress Management Standards include factors such
      as relationships with, and support from, other workers and managers. If
      these are not managed properly, they can lead to work-related stress.
      Being away from managers and colleagues could mean good support is more
      difficult to achieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      If contact is poor, employees may feel disconnected, isolated or
      abandoned, which can affect their performance and potentially their stress
      levels or mental health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting procedures in place that allow direct contact between the lone
      worker and their manager can help. Managing work-related stress relies on
      understanding what is ‘normal behaviour’ for an employee and recognising
      abnormal behaviour or symptoms at an early point.

      <p>Work-related violence</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Any form of violence against workers is unacceptable and may affect their
      psychological as well as their physical health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lone working does not automatically imply a higher risk of violence, but
      it does make workers more vulnerable. The lack of nearby support from a
      colleague means that lone workers may be less able to prevent an incident
      from occurring.
    </p>
