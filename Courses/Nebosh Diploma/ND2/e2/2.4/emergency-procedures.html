    <p>
      The risk assessment should identify foreseeable events. Emergency
      procedures should be established, put in place and employees should be
      trained in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lone workers should have access to adequate first-aid facilities and
      mobile workers should carry a first-aid kit suitable for treating minor
      injuries. Occasionally risk assessment may indicate that lone workers need
      training in first aid.
