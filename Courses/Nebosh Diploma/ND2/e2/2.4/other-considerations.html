    <p>
      Establishing safe working for lone workers is no different from organising
      the safety of other employees. The key question is whether or not the
      requirements can be met by people working alone. Issues requiring
      particular attention include:
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Can the risks of the job be adequately controlled by one person?</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Lone workers should not be at more risk than other employees. This may
      require extra risk - control measures for normal work and foreseeable
      emergencies.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Does the workplace present a special risk to the lone worker?</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Are the means of access and egress safe for a lone person?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Can work equipment be safely operated by one person?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Can work equipment and materials be safely handled by one person?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Non-native language speakers</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      If a lone worker is a non-native speaker, suitable arrangements should be
      made to provide clear communications, especially in an emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      All workers must receive and understand the information, instruction and
      training they need to work safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to communication challenges, cultural differences of migrant
      workers should also be considered.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Are young people or female workers at greater risk?</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Remember that young workers and new / expectant mothers require specific
      consideration during risk assessment.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Is the person medically fit and suitable to work alone?</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Employers should ensure that lone workers have no medical conditions that
      may make them unsuitable for working alone. Routine work and foreseeable
      emergencies should both be considered and medical advice should be sought
      if necessary.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>What training is required to ensure competency in safety matters?</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Limits should be set regarding what can and cannot be done alone.
      Employees should be competent to deal with new and unusual circumstances.
      Training is particularly important where there is limited supervision to
      control, guide and help in situations of uncertainty.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>How will the person be supervised?</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The extent of supervision required depends on the risks involved and the
      ability of the lone worker to identify and handle health and safety
      issues. Employees new to a job, undergoing training, doing a job which
      presents special risks, or dealing with new situations may need to be
      accompanied at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some high-risk activities where at least one other person may
      need to be present. Examples include working:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          in a confined space, where a supervisor may need to be present, along
          with someone dedicated to the rescue role
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          near exposed live electricity conductors
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          in diving operations, vehicles carrying explosives or fumigation.
