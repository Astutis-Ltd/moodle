      The overarching aim is to select PPE which gives maximum protection while
      ensuring minimum discomfort to the wearer, as uncomfortable equipment is
      unlikely to be worn properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When selecting suitable PPE there are four broad variables that should be
      considered around the basics of the hazard that the PPE is intended to
      protect against. As shown in the image and outlined in the table below,
      these are the task, the individual, the environment and the PPE itself.

      The PPE Regulations require employers to provide suitable information,
      instruction and training for their employees, to enable them to make
      effective use of the PPE provided to protect them against workplace
      hazards to their health and safety.
    </p>
    <p>Workers must be trained in:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">the proper use of PPE</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">how to correctly fit and wear it</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">what its limitations are.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Managers and supervisors must also be aware of why PPE is being used and
      how to use it properly. People involved in maintaining, repairing and
      testing the equipment and in its selection for use will also need
      training.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extent of the instruction and training will vary with the complexity
      and performance of the equipment. For PPE which is simple to use and
      maintain (safety helmets, for example) some basic instructions to the
      users will be all that is required.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, the safe use of Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE)
      will depend on an adequate understanding of the principles behind it. The
      instruction and training should include both theory and practice.
