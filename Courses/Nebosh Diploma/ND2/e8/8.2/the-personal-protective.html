      PPE is defined in the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations
      as:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        …all equipment (including clothing affording protection against the
        weather) which is intended to be worn or held by a person at work and
        which protects that person against one or more risks to his health or
        safety.

      <p>Charging for PPE</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      An employer cannot ask for money from an employee for PPE, whether it is
      returnable or not. This includes agency workers if they are legally
      regarded as your employees. If employment has been terminated and the
      employee keeps the PPE without the employer’s permission, then, as long as
      it has been made clear in the contract of employment, the employer may be
      able to deduct the cost of the replacement from any wages owed.
    </p>

      The PPE at Work Regulations do not apply where existing specific
      regulations already adequately cover the requirements for PPE. The
      specific regulations would take precedence over Regulation 4 of the PPE
      Regulations. Regulations 6-12 of the PPE Regulations would not apply.
