      Any items worn on the head for fashion, cosmetic or religious reasons can
      restrict the choice of RPE, for example: incompatibility with face mask
      head harnesses. If they cannot be eliminated, a loose-fitting hood worn
      over the accessory may be acceptable, provided it gives the required level
      of protection.

    <p>
      Any beard, stubble, thick sideburns, long hair or moustache in the region
      where a face mask is intended to seal to the face will cause leakage. If
      this facial hair cannot be eliminated, you should consider the use of
      loose-fitting facepieces, which do not rely on a tight seal in this
      region.

    <p>
      Deep cuts or scars, wrinkles, moles, warts etc. can affect the seal of
      masks to the face. If these are present in the face seal area, consider
      the use of loose-fitting facepieces.

    <p>
      Spectacles with side arms are incompatible with full face masks because
      they break the face seal. RPE manufacturers can supply special frames,
      which fit inside their masks. Spectacles may also interfere with the fit
      of half-masks, contact lenses may be preferable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Careful consideration and additional training is needed for contact lens
      or spectacle wearers and those using full-face RPE (masks, hoods etc.):

      Different forms of head-worn PPE can potentially interfere, to prevent one
      or more of the components from working correctly (goggles and half-masks,
      mask harnesses and safety helmets). Where possible, choose equipment where
      the different forms of protection required are integrally combined, for
      example: eye, face, head and respiratory protection provided by a
      fan-assisted helmet respirator.

      These include claustrophobia, heart disease, hearing defects, asthma and

      skin conditions. Pregnancy also falls under this heading.
