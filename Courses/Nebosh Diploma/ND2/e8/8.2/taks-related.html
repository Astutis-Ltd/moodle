    <p>
      Higher work rates are associated with increased breathing and sweating,
      which can affect the performance of some types of RPE and will influence
      the selection. Increased breathing rate can cause contaminants to leak in,
      and sweating can cause facepieces to slip and leak. Work rate is
      classified as:

      <p>Wear time</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Tight-fitting masks become uncomfortable to wear for long periods (>1
      hour). Because of this, wearers may be tempted to loosen or remove RPE.
      Tight-fitting masks with fan-assisted or compressed air-supplied RPE and
      loose-fitting facepieces will help minimise fatigue and discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>Classify wear time as:</p>
    <p>&lt;1 hour - wear time up to 1 hour.</p>
    <p>&gt;1 hour - wear time greater than 1 hour.</p>

    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Abnormal temperature or humidity</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      In hot and humid conditions, wearing RPE increases heat stress, sweating
      and discomfort. Using fan-assisted or compressed air-supplied BA would
      help to minimise the problems. In conditions of extreme cold, air flow
      associated with fan-assisted or compressed air-supplied BA can cause
      chilling effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proprietary cooling and / or heating devices are available from RPE
      manufacturers. However, proprietary heating / cooling devices using
      compressed air (vortex tubes) can place severe demand on the quantity of
      compressed air from supply systems.

      <p>Power tools used</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      If powered tools and BA are connected to the same air supply, it is
      essential to confirm that the compressor can supply enough air for both at
      the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also important to ensure that air jets from power tools (pneumatic
      or electric) do not impact on RPE valves located in masks. If this
      happens, the protection provided by the RPE can be greatly reduced.

      <p>Clarity of vision</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      If a worker needs to see fine details when wearing RPE, types which
      include face protection (full face masks, visors, hoods) may not be ideal
      because they can be prone to scratching, misting and surface
      contamination. In these cases, consider half-mask RPE, provide adequate
      lighting, or choose designs which resist scratching and internal misting.
      Fan-assisted or compressed air RPE are more resistant to misting. Some
      types include ‘tear-off’ consumable visors.

      <p>Clarity of communication</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      All RPE affects a worker’s ability to communicate. If the work requires
      clear and precise communication RPE incorporating proprietary
      communication devices should be used (ranging from simple speech
      diaphragms to complex radio intercom systems), or other suitable forms of
      communication.

      <p>Mobility</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Where mobility at different heights or over large areas is necessary to
      perform the work, certain types of RPE may cause safety hazards, for
      example: those with trailing hoses which can drag, snag or be a trip
      hazard. If you can’t avoid using trailing hoses, provide hose-support
      gantries or safe systems of work.

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Congested work area</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      If work in a congested area cannot be avoided, less bulky or restrictive
      RPE should be chosen. Example: smaller, lighter, and without trailing
      hoses.

    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Potentially explosive atmosphere</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      If working in potentially explosive atmospheres, including oxygen-enriched
      (levels above 20.8%), intrinsically safe, light-alloy free and antistatic,
      RPE may be required.
