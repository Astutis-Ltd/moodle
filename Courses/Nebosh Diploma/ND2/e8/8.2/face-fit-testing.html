          Once the correct RPE has been chosen, it is important to ensure that
          it fits each individual correctly. The performance of a tight fitting
          facepiece (i.e. full face mask, a half face mask, or a filtering
          facepiece) relies heavily on the goodness of fit of the facepiece to
          the wearer’s face. An inadequate fit will significantly reduce the
          protection provided to the wearer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fit testing is required to ensure that selected RPE can provide
          adequate protection for the individual wearer. It checks that a tight
          fitting facepiece matches the person’s facial features and seals
          adequately to the wearer’s face. It is also a good tool for screening
          out incompatible RPE.

      Facepiece fit testing could also be used as a training tool to show the
      consequences to performance of poor fitting and misuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The requirement for RPE facepiece fit testing is described in the Approved
      Code of Practices (ACoPs) supporting the following Regulations:

    <p>
      There are two basic types of RPE fit testing – qualitative and
      quantitative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Qualitative fit</span>testing: is a simple pass /
      fail test based on the wearer’s subjective assessment of the leakage, via
      the face seal region, of a test agent. If the wearer can detect the test
      agent (either a bitter or sweet tasting aerosol, or an odourous compound)
      the fit test is failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Quantitative fit</span> testing: provides a
      numerical measure of the fit that is called a fit factor. These tests give
      an objective measure of face fit. They require specialised equipment and
      are more complicated to carry out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fit test reports should be available for all employees who wear RPE
      incorporating tight fitting facepieces. The records should be retained by
      the employer and kept available for inspection on request.
