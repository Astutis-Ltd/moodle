      RPE is considered <span class="ast-bold">suitable</span> if it is adequate
      and is matched to the wearer, the task and the working environment, so
      that the wearer can work with minimum impediment and without additional
      risks due to the protective equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      RPE is considered <span class="ast-bold">adequate</span> if it can provide
      a level of protection required to reduce the exposure to comply with the
      law.
    </p>
    <p>
      RPE should only be selected and used after a justification has been made
      in the risk assessment required by law. It can be used in the following
      situations:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Where an inhalation exposure risk remains after other reasonable
          controls have been put in place, i.e. residual risk
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Short-term or infrequent exposures where other controls at source are
          not reasonably practicable
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          While putting in place other control measures (interim measures)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Emergency escape for safe exit from an area where hazardous substances
          may be released suddenly in the event of control systems failures, for
          example: a chlorine tank
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Emergency work or temporary failure of controls where other means of
          controls are not reasonably practicable
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Where emergency rescue by trained personnel is necessary.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      However, there may be also circumstances to issue RPE, not because other
      control measures are inadequate on their own, but to provide additional
      protection if any of the control measures fail to operate. In this type of
      situation, specialist support should be sought from, for example, an
      occupational hygienist.

      In order to decide on the suitability and selection the following factors
      must be taken into account: chemical and toxicological related factors,
      task related factors and worker related factors.
