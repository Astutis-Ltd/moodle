      As of 6th April 2022, the
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >Personal Protective Equipment at Work (Amendment) Regulations
        2022</span
      >
      (PPER 2022) come into force and amend the 1992 Regulations (PPER 1992).
    </p>
    <p>
      Under PPER 2022, the types of duties and responsibilities on employers and
      employees under PPER 1992 will remain unchanged but will extend to limb
      (b) workers, as defined in PPER 2022.
    </p>
    <p>
      The definition of worker under section 230(3) of the
      <span class="ast-italic">Employment Rights Act 1996</span> has 2 limbs:

          employees under the
          <span class="ast-italic">Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974</span>
          and are covered by the requirements of PPER 1992

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Limb (b) workers generally have a more casual employment relationship

        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>PPER 2022 now defines a ‘worker’ as:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">
        “an individual who has entered into, or works under:

      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">(a) a contract of employment; or</p>
      <p>
        (b) any other contract, whether express or implied and (if it is
        express) whether oral or in writing, whereby the individual undertakes
        to do or perform personally any work or services for another party to
        the contract whose status is not by virtue of the contract that of a
        client or customer of any profession or business undertaking carried on
        by the individual”

    </div>

    <p>
      The employers obligation to assess risk and ensure suitable PPE is
      provided, when needed, now applies to all people that fall under the
      definition of worker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The PPE provided must be compatible, maintained and correctly stored. All
      workers must use the PPE properly following training and instruction in
      its use from their employer. If the PPE you provide is lost or becomes
      defective, your worker should report that to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      All workers must be provided with suitable PPE free of charge, where
      required and the employer must ensure it is:

      PPE should be regarded as the last resort to protect against risks to
      health and safety. Engineering controls and safe systems of work should be
      considered first. This is because:

      In addition, PPE may restrict the wearer to some extent by limiting
