    <p>
      Dilution ventilation is a term used to define the flow of air into and out
      of a working area, so that any contaminants are diluted by adding some
      fresh air. It can be provided by:

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Natural ventilation which relies on wind pressure and temperature
          differences to move fresh air through a building and is usually not
          fully controllable
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          ‘Forced’ or mechanical ventilation which uses mechanical supply and /
          or extraction to provide fresh air and is controllable.

    <p>
      Dilution ventilation is sometimes called general ventilation. As ‘general
      ventilation’ is also used to describe a buildings overall heating,
      ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems ‘dilution ventilation’ is
      the better term when referring to contaminant control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Systems can also be designed to displace rather than dilute contaminated
      air. At its simplest dispersal ventilation involves injecting air into a
      space in such a way that new air displaces the air previously there
      without mixing with it.

      When used to control airborne contaminants dilution ventilation is limited
      to the following situations:

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          small quantities of contaminants are released at fairly uniform rates
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          there is sufficient distance from the source to the worker to allow
          for dilution
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          contaminants are of relatively low toxicity or fire hazard
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          no air-cleaning device is needed to collect contaminants before the
          exhaust air is discharged

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the diluted contaminants do not cause corrosion or other problems.

    <p>
      An example of a work situation where dilution ventilation would be useful
      is in diluting organic vapours from low toxicity solvents such as in floor
      tile adhesive.
    </p>
    <p>Conversely dilution ventilation has a number of limitations, i.e.</p>

    <p>
      When designing a mechanical dilution ventilation system careful
      consideration must be given to the locations of the air inlet and exhaust
      relative to the worker and the source of the contaminant. As shown in the
      figure below, contaminated air is drawn away from the workers breathing
      zone if the exhaust is close to the front of the worker and the air inlet
      (makeup air) is behind the worker.
    </p>

    <p>
      The illustration above shows a system featuring mechanical fans exhausting
      contaminated air and providing fresh make up air. Air input can also be
      provided naturally through windows, doors or vents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at this illustration it is easy to picture air moving through the
      work area in a straight path from the air inlet to the exhaust fan,
      however the reality is somewhat different. The incoming air diffuses
      throughout the room. Some of it passes through the zone of contaminant
      release and dilutes the contaminants to a lower concentration. The
      dilution continues as the material moves farther from the process until
      the contaminated air is removed by the exhaust fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position and number of air inputs should be arranged so as to help
      deliver effective dispersion and dilution of the contaminated air.
      Consideration will need to be given to the impact of cross drafts and
      thermal / convection currents and to avoid any ‘dead spots’ where stagnant
      contaminated air may sit. It is worth noting that complete mixing of air
      rarely occurs in real world situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equations for calculating dilution or displacement airflow are beyond the
      scope of the Diploma syllabus. However, you may be expected to calculate a
      room’s volume in metres cubed (length x width x height) and to determine
      the number of air changes per hour if given a volume of air throughput per
      hour (in m<sup>3</sup> or litres - where 1m<sup>3</sup> = 1000l).
