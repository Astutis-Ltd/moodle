          The
          <span class="ast-bold">sound absorption coefficient</span> indicates
          how well a material absorbs the sound energy it receives. The higher
          the figure the more sound is absorbed. The coefficient can be
          determined for sounds at different frequencies. It is calculated as:

          <div class="ast-flex--center">
            <div style="margin-left: 10px">
              <p class="ast-text-align--center" style="margin-top: 20px">
                intensity of sound absorbed by material
              </p>

              <p class="ast-text-align--center" style="margin-bottom: 20px">
                intensity of sound incident on the same area of material
              </p>

          Sound absorption coefficients for common building materials can be
          found in Approved Document E to the Building Regulations.

          The <span class="ast-bold">Sound Reduction Index (SRI)</span> or
          ‘transmission loss’ is a measure of the attenuation provided by a
          material. It is the difference in dB between the noise energy falling
          onto a material, and the level transmitted through it. Real world
          measures are unlikely to match the stated index, which is determined
          by laboratory tests and does not address secondary transmission
          pathways.
