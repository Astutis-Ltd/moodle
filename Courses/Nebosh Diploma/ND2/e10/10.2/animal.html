    <p>
      Influenza is a viral disease common to man and a limited number of lower
      animal species mainly horses, pigs, domestic birds and wild birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 3 types of influenza viruses A, B and C. Types B and C are human
      viruses mainly affecting young children and causing a mild disease. Type A
      virus is the important type as far as cross-species infections are
      concerned. Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two
      proteins seen as ‘spikes’ on the surface of the virus: the hemagglutinin
      (H) and the neuraminidase (N). There are 18 different hemagglutinin
      subtypes and 11 different neuraminidase subtypes. Each virus has one type
      of H (such as H1) and one type of N (such as N1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Wild birds are the primary natural reservoir for all subtypes of influenza
      A viruses and are thought to be the source of influenza A viruses in all
      other animals. Most influenza viruses cause asymptomatic or mild infection
      in birds, however, the range of symptoms in birds varies greatly depending
      on the properties of the virus.

      Humans are the <span class="ast-bold">reservoir</span> for human flu
      infections but as discussed below animal reservoirs such as pigs are
      responsible for the re-assortment of type A flu viruses which may affect
      humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main <span class="ast-bold">mode of transmission</span> is airborne
      spread particularly amongst large crowds in enclosed spaces. Other modes
      of transmission include direct contact through droplets (coughing /
      sneezing) and dried mucus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incubation period is usually up to five days and the period of
      communicability is up to seven days after onset of symptoms.

    <p>
      Most people with the flu have mild illness and do not need medical care.
      People in high risk groups or with complications should seek medical
      advice and may require anti-viral drugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flu prevention is generally through the annual flu vaccine and good
      personal hygiene. Additional precautions will be required in the case of a
      pandemic.

      <p>Pandemic flu</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      A Pandemic is a widespread epidemic that affects a large proportion of
      populations on different continents and that possibly circulates around
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      On average there have been three influenza pandemics in each century for
      the last 300 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spanish Flu (H1N1) pandemic of 1918 is estimated to have made 30% of
      the global population ill and killed 50 million people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most recent flu pandemic was the 2009 ‘swine flu’ pandemic (also H1N1)
      which was estimated to be responsible for 10 000 deaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Influenza pandemics occur when a new strain of the influenza virus is
      transmitted to humans from another animal species. Species that are
      thought to be important in the emergence of new human strains are pigs,
      chickens and ducks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because pigs are susceptible to avian, human and swine influenza viruses,
      they potentially may be infected with influenza viruses from different
      species (e.g., ducks and humans) at the same time. If this happens, it is
      possible for the genes of these viruses to mix (undergo a ‘re-assortment
      event’ and create a new virus.
    </p>
    <p>
      These novel strains are unaffected by any immunity people may have to
      older strains of human influenza and can therefore spread extremely
      rapidly and infect very large numbers of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recent examples of influenza viruses with pandemic potential include avian
      influenza A (H5N1) and avian influenza H7N9, which are two different ‘bird
      flu’ viruses. These are non-human viruses (i.e., they are novel among
      humans and circulate in birds in parts of the world) so there is little to
      no immunity against these viruses among people. Human infections with
      these viruses have occurred rarely, but if either of these viruses was to
      change in such a way that it was able to infect humans easily and spread
      easily from person to person, an influenza pandemic could result.
    </p>
    <p>
      As can be seen from Figure 10.1 the H7N9 virus currently circulating in
      China the H7N9 is closely related to avian influenza viruses found in
      domestic ducks, wild birds and domestic poultry in Asia and seems to have
      been created by a number of ‘re-assortment events’.

    <p>
      The transportation of influenza viruses throughout the world is thought in
      part to be by bird migrations, though commercial shipments of live bird
      products might also be implicated, as well as human travel plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The WHO’s Global Influenza Programme (GIP) provides Member States with
      strategic guidance, technical support and coordination of activities
      essential to make their health systems better prepared against seasonal,
      zoonotic and pandemic influenza threats to populations and individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UK government has a pandemic influenza preparedness strategy and
      response plans in place to coordinate the public health and health
      services responses to mitigate the impact of a serious pandemic flu
      outbreak.

    <p>
      As is now well known an outbreak of a novel, zoonotic coronavirus occurred
      in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China and quickly spread to affect
      the entire world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the animal source of the infection has not been definitively
      identified, horse shoe bats in the region are known to carry genetically
      similar viruses. It is likely that an intermediate animal (e.g. civet cat,
      fox, mink, or raccoon dog), traded in the wet markets of the area was
      infected by a bat, reassorted the virus DNA and transmitted to the first
      infected humans.
