    <p>The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in the USA defines zoonoses as</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        infections or infectious diseases transmissible, under natural
        conditions, between vertebrate animals and humans.

    <p>
      Zoonotic diseases may be endemic (enzootic) or epidemic (epizootic). See
      the glossary of terms at the end of this section for definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least 61% of all human pathogens are zoonotic.There are approximately
      40 potential zoonoses in the UK and approximately 300 000 people in a
      variety of occupations are potentially exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This suggests about 4 300 and 12 500 cases annually. Although most of
      these infections are mild and self-limiting, there is increasing evidence
      some acute infections may cause long term health effects.

      The HSE has produced guidance aimed at agricultural workers, which
      outlines the duties under CoSHH and the relatively simple control measures
      which may be required e.g. hand washing.

          The principles of control will be applicable to other similar
          diseases.

          In an open book examination you may be expected to research other
          diseases.
