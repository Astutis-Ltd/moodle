    <p>
      Rapid mutation of viruses (hyper-variability or spontaneous evolution)
      makes detection and treatment of viral infections difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many viruses, especially RNA (ribonucleic acid) viruses, have short
      generation times and relatively high mutation rates which, when combined
      with natural selection, allows viruses to quickly adapt to environmental
      changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many recent disease outbreaks, such as bird flu, nipah virus and SARS,
      have occurred as a result of viral mutations. Further mutations of viruses
      such as H5N1 bird flu may make human to human transmission easier in the
      future.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The incubation period is the time between catching an infection and
      symptoms appearing. Incubation periods vary, depending on the type of
      infection. The period may be as short as minutes, to as long as thirty
      years, in the case of CJD (variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease).
    </p>
    <p>
      The latent period is the time from infection to infectiousness. Which is
      shorter, depends on the disease.

    <p>
      The term <span class="ast-bold">‘infection’</span> relates to the growth
      of a parasitic organism within the body. A person with an infection has
      another organism growing within him, drawing its nourishment from the
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term <span class="ast-bold">‘infection’</span> has some exceptions.
      For example, the normal growth of the usual bacterial flora in the
      intestinal tract is not usually considered an infection. The same
      consideration applies to the bacteria that normally inhabit the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term <span class="ast-bold">‘infectious’</span> indicates the
      comparative ease with which the disease is transmitted to other hosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="ast-bold">‘infectious</span> period’ is not necessarily
      the same as the incubation period. With some infections, such as
      chickenpox, the person may be infectious before symptoms start to show.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Approved List of biological agents, from the HSE, classifies
      biological agents according to how infectious the agent is (see section
      10.5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Individuals who are asymptomatic (have no symptoms) may be infective, and
      therefore able to pass on the infection to others. Even after symptoms
      have finally subsided an individual may still be infective for some weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="ast-bold">‘infectious</span> dose’ is the amount of
      pathogen (measured in numbers of organisms) required to cause infection in
      the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process of infection can be represented as a chain - breaking a link
      in the chain at any point will control the risk of infection. It is
      important to identify the hazard and find out about the links in the
      chain. This will help to identify the best way of breaking the chain, and
      so controlling the risk.

      <p>Rapid multiplication</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Whether or not a microorganism causes ill-health, or not, is related to
      the dose (infectious dose) – either the colony size (numbers of bacteria),
      or the amount of toxin produced (more bacteria = more toxins).
    </p>
    <p>
      All microorganisms can multiply rapidly under optimal conditions.
      Bacterial multiplication occurs by binary fission, i.e. one cell splits
      into two daughter cells - 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16 → 32 → 64 → etc. so growth is
      exponential.
    </p>
    <p>
      The variables that can be manipulated to provide (or remove) optimal
      conditions include:
