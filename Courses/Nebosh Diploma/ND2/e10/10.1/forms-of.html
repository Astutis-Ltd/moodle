    <p>
      Bacteria are living microscopic organisms (typically < 1μm), which lack
      cells with internal membranes. Bacteria contain DNA, but this differs from
      cellular DNA in that it has a circular arrangement, rather than linear.
      Bacteria are single celled and can reproduce by duplicating themselves -
      they do not need a host to survive. Bacteria (for example: tetanus and
      most forms of pneumonia) are responsive to antibiotics.
    </p>
    <p>Bacteria may be classified in a number of ways:</p>

          Their need for oxygen for growth. Aerobic bacteria (aerobes) can
          survive and grow in an oxygenated environment, whereas anaerobic
          bacteria (anaerobes) do not require oxygen for growth. Anaerobic,
          bacteria can survive in places where there is less oxygen, such as
          human intestines and cause gastroenteric illness

      A virus is smaller than one cell. It lives within a cell (intracellular)

    <p>
      Viruses are not really ‘alive’ as they cannot reproduce outside of a
      living cell. They reproduce by transmitting their genetic information from
      one cell to another. However, they can damage or kill the cells that they
      infect, causing disease in infected organisms. Some cause cancers by
      stimulating cells to grow uncontrollably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body will fight off most viruses over the course of time, but viruses
      are not responsive to antibiotics. Antibiotics are intended to kill living
      things and a virus is not a living thing. Therefore viruses cause many
      infectious diseases that have no cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antiviral treatments are difficult to create because of the large number
      of variant viruses that can cause the same disease. A further concern is
      the difficulty in disabling a virus without disabling healthy cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, vaccines do not cure viruses, so the only way to protect a
      human from viruses is through specific vaccines, which help to build
      antibodies against the virus. There is not a vaccine for every virus.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Fungi are a diverse group of organisms that obtain food by direct
      absorption of nutrients. The food is dissolved by enzymes that the fungi
      excrete, and is then absorbed through thin cell walls. This is then
      distributed by simple circulation, or streaming, of the protoplasm.
    </p>
    <p>Fungi may be single-celled or multi-cellular.</p>
    <p>
      Fungal infections include ringworm and athletes foot. In healthy people
      fungal infections are usually mild, involving superficial sites, and they
      clear up spontaneously. However, if the immune system has been compromised
      in some way by stress or other factors, humans are much more susceptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occupationally the spores of the aspergillus fungus can cause
      aspergillosis or ‘farmer’s lung’, (allergic inflammation of the alveoli).
    </p>
    <p>
      Fungi do not respond to antibiotics in the true sense - they do respond to
      a fungicide.
    </p>
    <p>Fungal agents, such as fungal pneumonia, reproduce in two ways:</p>

      Protozoans are living, motile, single-celled organisms that can live
      inside or outside host cells or organisms. They can only divide within a
      host organism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most antibiotics, such as penicillin, don’t work on protozoan diseases.
      However, they are susceptible to some antibiotics such as sulfonamides.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are four classes of protozoa, all of which have parasitic
