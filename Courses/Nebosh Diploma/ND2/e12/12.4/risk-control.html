      The hierarchy for control which minimises the risk from vibration
      exposure, in order of priority, is as follows:

    <p>
      The most effective and reliable way of eliminating the risk from vibration
      is to design (or redesign) work processes so that employees are not
      exposed to vibration at all.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Reduce exposure by mechanisation</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Mechanisation, the use of robotics, remote control or other forms of
      automation can eliminate or reduce exposure.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->

      <p>Reduce exposure by good process control</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Good process control is important for maintaining product quality and
      production efficiency; and can also help reduce overall vibration
      exposure. Improving the quality control can minimise the need for remedial
      work using powered tools for chiselling, grinding, cutting, sanding etc.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Avoid high-vibration machines and accessories</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      After doing all that is reasonably practicable to replace or modify work
      processes, employees may still be exposed to vibration. If so,
      unnecessarily high vibration exposures should be avoided by careful
      selection of work equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The available vibration emission information for a range machines of a
      similar type should be reviewed and a maximum level of vibration emission
      for the specific machine class should be determined and specified for
      future purchase or hire.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Maintain machines and accessories</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Power tools and other work equipment should be serviced and maintained in
      accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s maintenance schedules. Cutting tools
      should be kept sharp, worn components replaced etc.
    </p>

    <div class="ast-heading--h3">

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      When the use of vibrating equipment and exposure to vibration is, it is
      often possible to control the extent to which damaging vibration is
      transmitted to the body. For HAV this involves minimising grip and push
      (or feed) forces. For WBV the use of properly adjusted suspension seats
      ids recommended.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Reduce the durations of exposure (including job rotation)</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      When the vibration levels have been reduced so far as is reasonably
      practicable, further reduction in exposure can only be achieved by
      limiting the time employees are exposed to vibration. This can be
      essential to keep exposures below the ELV.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Keeping warm and dry (for HAV)</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Low hand or body temperature increases the risk of finger blanching
      because of reduced blood circulation. Gloves and other warm clothing can
      help vibration exposed workers maintain good circulation.
