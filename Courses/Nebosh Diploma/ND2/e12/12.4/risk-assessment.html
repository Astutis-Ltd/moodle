    <p>
      An employer who carries out work which is liable to expose employees to
      risk from vibration is required to make a suitable and sufficient
      assessment of the risks to health and safety created by that work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The risk assessment must include an assessment of the daily exposure to
      vibration by means of: observation of working practices and reference to
      relevant information on the probable magnitude of the vibration. The
      employees are liable to be exposed.
    </p>
    <p>The risk assessment must also consider:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the magnitude, type and duration of exposure, including any exposure
          to intermittent vibration or repeated shocks
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the effects of exposure to vibration on employees whose health is at
          particular risk from such exposure
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          any effects of vibration on the workplace and work equipment
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the proper handling of controls, the reading of indicators, the
          stability of structures and the security of joints
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          any information provided by the manufacturers of work equipment
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the availability of replacement equipment designed to reduce exposure
          to vibration
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          any extension of exposure at the workplace to whole-body vibration
          beyond normal working hours, including exposure in rest facilities
          supervised by the employer
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          specific working conditions such as low temperatures
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          appropriate information obtained from health surveillance including,
          where possible, published information.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>At its simplest the process involves:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          making an inventory of equipment that may cause vibration and the sort
          of work it is used for
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          collecting information from the manufacturers’ handbook regarding:
          make, model, power, vibration magnitude, other risk factors etc.
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          listing all employees who use the vibrating equipment and for what
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          accurately recording the exposure time (‘trigger time’ that workers
          hands are in contact with the vibrating equipment for HAV)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          consulting with employees about their experiences and any particular
          concerns
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          recording the relevant information including the assessment of who is
          likely to be at risk.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Work activities can then be grouped as high, medium or low risk where high
      risk means exposure is above the ELV and medium risk above the EAV and
      action prioritised accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more detailed assessment can be made by using manufacturers’ vibration
      magnitude information and measures of exposure time in conjunction with
      the HSE’s exposure calculator or ready reckoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      If information is not available and vibration measurements are required
      they need to be made by a competent person with the appropriate
      specialised equipment. Measurement results can be highly variable and a
      competent experienced assessor is essential to produce accurate
      representative vibration data.
