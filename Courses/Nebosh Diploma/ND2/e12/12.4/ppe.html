    <p>
      Several different types of anti-vibration gloves are available. The amount
      of vibration reduction they provide depends on the thickness and softness
      of the lining, which is usually a resilient gel, foam or rubberlike
      material or an array of air bladders.
    </p>
    <p>Gloves are generally:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          most effective at higher frequencies, above the main vibration
          frequency of most power tools and at frequencies whose contribution to
          the frequency-weighted vibration magnitude is likely to be minimal
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          ineffective at reducing the most problematic lower frequencies of
          vibration that have the greatest effect on exposure.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      To protect against lower vibration frequencies the contact areas of the
      glove need to contain thicker resilient material, which can seriously
      limit dexterity, making them unsafe to use. Comfort may also be affected,
      making them unacceptable to employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      If operators need to tighten their grip on the tool to compensate for the
      effect of glove wearing this may actually increase the risk of vibration
      injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloves marketed in Europe as anti-vibration must carry the CE mark and
      have been tested and found to meet the requirements of BS EN ISO 10819.

    <p>
      A range of wearable technologies are available for measuring exposure to
      hand arm vibration. Sensors can be integrated into gloves or wristwear to
      monitor exposure dose and provide early warnings that the daily exposure
      action value is being approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the technologies continue to evolve there is research to confirm
      the accuracy of many of the available devices. Concerns include accuracy
      over time, impact of wear and tear, need for recalibration and the human
      factors regarding wearing and looking after the equipment and responding
      to warnings in a timely manner.
