      As was explained in Element 3, health surveillance is a term used to
      describe a system of ongoing health checks, typically required by law,
      whereas health monitoring is used where the causal relationship between
      exposure and harm is less clear and consequently there is no specific
      legal duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      As will be shown, health surveillance (medical surveillance) is required
      to check for the early signs of vibration white finger, whereas more
      general health monitoring arrangements are use to track the health state
      of drivers exposed to whole body vibration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medical assessments are more appropriate for HAVS as the early signs of
      Vibration White Finger (VWF) can be tested for.

      Health surveillance is a programme of systematic health checks to identify
      early signs and symptoms of disease and to allow action to be taken to
      prevent its progression. It also checks the long-term effectiveness of
      control measures to safeguard the health of employees (including
      identifying and protecting people at increased risk).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of HAV, one of the aims is to prevent employees developing
      hand-arm vibration syndrome associated with loss of hand function. It is
      possible that your employees who are exposed to vibration have mild
      symptoms of HAVS, the relevance of which they are not aware. Health
      surveillance can help them to recognise the significance of their
      symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appropriate health surveillance must be provided for hand-arm
      vibration-exposed employees who:

              An employee diagnosed with HAVS should be reassessed at regular
