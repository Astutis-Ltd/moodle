    <p>
      The electromagnetic spectrum has two major divisions: ionising and
      non-ionising radiation.

    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Non-ionising</span> radiation has enough energy to
      move atoms in a molecule around or cause them to vibrate, but not enough
      to remove electrons. Examples of non-ionising radiation include visible
      light, and microwaves. Non-ionising radiation is discussed in more detail
      in Section 13.2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Ionising</span> radiation has enough energy to
      remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, thus creating ions. Ionisation
      is the process in which a charged portion of a molecule (usually an
      electron) is given enough energy to break away from the atom. This process
      results in the formation of two charged particles or ions: the molecule
      with a net positive charge, and the free electron with a negative charge.
      Each ionisation releases approximately 33eV of energy which is absorbed
      into the material surrounding the atom. The 33eV from one ionisation is
      more than enough energy to disrupt the chemical bond between two carbon
      atoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      All ionising radiation is capable, directly or indirectly, of removing
      electrons from most molecules. Higher frequency ultraviolet radiation
      begins to have enough energy to break chemical bonds. X-ray and gamma ray
      radiation, which are at the upper end of the spectrum, have very high
      frequency and extremely high energy which may be sufficient to break up
      the nucleus of atoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ionising radiation may occur naturally from the deterioration of
      radioactive substances which release energy (gamma rays and x-rays) and
      shed high speed charged particles (alpha particles and beta particles), in
      an attempt to reach a stable state. Ionising radiation is discussed in
      more detail in Element 7.3.
