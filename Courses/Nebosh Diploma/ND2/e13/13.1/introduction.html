      Electromagnetic energy travels in waves and spans a broad spectrum from
      very long radio waves to very short gamma rays. The human eye can detect
      only a small portion of this spectrum as visible light.

    <p>
      Radiations are produced by the acceleration or sudden movement of
      electrons, which results in an interlocked pair of electric and magnetic
      fields oscillating at the frequency of the electron current. The electric
      field is created by the charge on the electrons. The magnetic field is
      produced whenever charges move, and is proportional to the size of the
      current.
    </p>
    <p>
      A changing magnetic field will induce a changing electric field and
      vice-versa. The changing fields form electromagnetic waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Electromagnetic waves are transverse waves, but are different to
      mechanical waves in that they do not require a medium to propagate, i.e.
      they can travel through a vacuum as well as air and solid materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speed of all electromagnetic radiations in a vacuum is the same,
      regardless of frequency. It is also the same as the speed of light.

    <p>
      Electromagnetic energy can be described by frequency, wavelength, or
      energy. The three are related mathematically, so if one is known the other
      two can be calculated.
