      The word laser is an acronym, which stands for
      <span class="ast-bold">L</span>ight
      <span class="ast-bold">A</span>mplification by the

      A laser beam is electromagnetic radiation just like the light from a light
      bulb, but unlike the light bulb:

              <span class="ast-bold">Coherence</span> refers to a property
              holding for two or more waves or fields when each individual wave
              or field is in phase with every other one. Lasers, for example,
              emit almost perfectly coherent light. All the photons emitted by a
              laser have the same frequency and are in phase.

      Energy from a flash lamp, an electrical discharge, or other source is
      pumped into the active (or lasing) material contained within the laser
      cavity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the energy is absorbed the individual atoms in the active material move
      into an ‘excited’ state. This energy is re-emitted as optical radiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirrors at either end of the laser cavity reflect the radiation back into
      the active medium. This stimulates the active medium into producing laser
      radiation, which is amplified by the process of stimulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the mirrors is only half silvered and partially transmits some of
      the laser radiation as the laser beam.

      Lasers are commonly designated by the active material employed, be it a
      solid, gas, liquid or semiconductor:

          In a <span class="ast-bold">solid-state laser</span> the active
          material is distributed in a solid matrix. Example: ruby or ‘Yag’
          (Yttrium Aluminium Garnet)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">Gas lasers</span> have a primary output of
          visible red light. Helium and helium-neon (HeNe) are the most common
          gas lasers. CO2 lasers emit energy in the far-infrared, and are used
          for cutting hard materials

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">Excimer lasers</span> use reactive gases, such
          as chlorine and fluorine, mixed with inert gases such as argon,
          krypton or xenon. When electrically stimulated, a pseudo molecule
          (dimer) is produced creating light in the ultraviolet range

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">Dye lasers</span> use complex organic dyes,
          such as rhodamine 6G, in liquid solution or suspension as active
          media. They are tuneable over a broad range of wavelengths

          <span class="ast-bold">Semiconductor (or diode) lasers</span> are not
          solid-state lasers. They are generally very small, low power,
          electronic devices that may be built into larger arrays, such as the
          writing source in some laser printers or CD players.
