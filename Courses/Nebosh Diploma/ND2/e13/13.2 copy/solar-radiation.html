    <p>
      The sun emits all 3 types of ultraviolet radiation discussed earlier. UVC
      radiation is blocked by the ozone layer and does not reach the earth’s
      surface, whilst UVA and UVB both reach the earth’s surface and penetrate
      the skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      UVA rays have the longest wavelength that can penetrate deeply into
      tissue. UVA rays can reach and affect the middle layers of the skin called
      the dermis, causing the skin to ‘age’.
    </p>
    <p>
      UVB rays are mid wavelength and reach the outer layer of the skin, or
      epidermis. UVB is the most biologically harmful causing sunburn, damaging
      the DNA in skin cells which can lead to skin cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outdoor workers are at an increased risk of skin cancer caused by exposure
      to the sun (solar ultraviolet radiation). Cancer mortality and incidence
      data for Great Britain suggest that construction workers account for
      around 58% of occupational cancer deaths and 55%of occupational cancer
      cases attributed to sun exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      IOSH commissioned research (2015) has identified the need for construction
      sector employers to develop sun safety strategies and cultures to ensure
      that the seriousness of the issue is recognised and understood and that an
      effective framework of controls is implemented and enforced.
    </p>
    <p>The framework of controls should include:</p>
