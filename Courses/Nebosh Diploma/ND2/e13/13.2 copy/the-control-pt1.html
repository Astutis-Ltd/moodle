    <p>
      Artificial Optical Radiation (AOR) means any electromagnetic radiation in
      the wavelength range between 100nm and 1mm which is emitted by non-natural
      sources.

      <p>Regulation 2: Application</p>

    <p>
      Where an employer has a duty in respect of his employees, the employer is
      under a like duty (so far as is reasonably practicable) in respect of any
      other person at work who may be affected by the work, except for provision
      of information and training (Regulation 5) and health surveillance
      (Regulation 6).

    <p>
      Where the employer carries out work which could expose employees to levels
      of artificial optical radiation that could create a reasonably foreseeable
      risk of adverse health effects to the eyes or skin, and has not
      implemented controls in accordance with the general principles of
      prevention set out in Schedule 1 to the
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999,</span
      >
      the employer must make a suitable and sufficient assessment of that risk
      for the purpose of identifying the measures necessary to meet the
      requirements of these Regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of the risk assessment process the employer should assess, and if
      necessary, measure or calculate, the levels of artificial optical
      radiation to which employees are likely to be exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assessments, measurements and calculations, must be made in accordance
      with the following standards or recommendations:
