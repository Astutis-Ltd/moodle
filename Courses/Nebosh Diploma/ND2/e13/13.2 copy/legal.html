      Before 2010 there was no specific legislation for the workplace safety
      using non-ionising radiations in the UK. Until 2010 the issue was
      legislated for under the general requirements of these acts and
      regulations:

      Annexes I and II of the Physical Agents - Artificial Optical Radiation
      Directive (2006/25/EC) provide Exposure Limit Values (ELVs) for
      non-coherent optical radiation and laser radiation, respectively. The ELVs
      are based on the Guidelines published by the International Commission on
      Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).
    </p>
    <p>
      The UK Artificial Optical Radiation Regulations refer directly to the
      Directive Annexes.
    </p>
    <p>The ELVs take account of:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the biological effectiveness of the optical radiation at causing harm
          at different wavelengths
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the duration of exposure to the optical radiation

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">the target tissue.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The use of the ELVs for non-coherent optical radiation is generally more
      complex than for laser radiation. This is due to worker exposure
      potentially being to a range of wavelengths instead of a single
      wavelength. However, it is possible to make a number of simplifying,
      worst-case, assumptions to determine if a more detailed assessment is
      required.
    </p>
    <p>
      The annexe to the electromagnetic fields directive details the exposure
      limit and action values for electromagnetic fields.
    </p>

      <p>Electromagnetic Fields (EMF)</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      ELVs are determined on the basis of biophysical and biological
      considerations, in particular the scientifically well-established
      short-term and acute direct effects, i.e. thermal effects and electrical
      stimulation of tissues.
    </p>
    <p>
      ELVs are classified as
      <span class="ast-bold">‘health effects ELVs’</span> or
      <span class="ast-bold">‘sensory effects ELVs’.</span>
      Health effects ELVs are those above which workers might be subject to
      adverse health effects, such as thermal heating or stimulation of nerve
      and muscle tissue. Sensory effects ELVs are those above which workers
      might be subject to transient disturbed sensory perceptions and minor
      changes in brain functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      ELVs are often impossible or difficult and expensive to measure directly.
      For this reason a separate set of values, known as Action Levels (ALs),
      has been produced relating to quantities which can be measured more
      easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The annexes to the directive detail the exposure limit and action levels
      for exposure to electromagnetic fields in various frequency ranges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health effect ELVs for electromagnetic fields are presented as SARs
      (Specific energy Absorption Rates). SARs as defined by the ICNIRP and WHO
      are:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        a measure of the rate at which energy is absorbed by unit mass of tissue
        in an electromagnetic field. It is measured in the units of watts per
        kilogram - W / kg or Wkg-1.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      All Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values are averaged over any 6-min
      period and localised SAR values are averaged over a 10g contiguous mass of
      tissue.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example the health effects ELVs for exposure to electromagnetic
      fields from 100kHz to 6GHz, as specified in the EMF Directive are:
