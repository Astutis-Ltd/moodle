      The British Standard user’s guide for laser safety, PD IEC TR
      60825-14:2004 recommends that a Laser Safety Officer (LSO) is appointed
      where Class 3B and Class 4 lasers are used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The required level of competence of a Laser Safety Officer should be
      balanced against the risks from the work with the laser, including any
      maintenance or servicing operations. Laser safety expertise may only be
      required at the start of the work with the laser product and when changes
      are made. In such circumstances expertise in all aspects of laser safety
      would be unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term Laser Protection Adviser (LPA) is used to describe a person (or
      organisation) who can be consulted on complex laser safety management
      issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of Class 3B and Class 4 lasers and Intense Pulse Light (IPL)
      systems in the independent healthcare sector is currently regulated across
      the UK by:

      The National Minimum Standards used in England and Wales specifically
      require a Laser Protection Adviser (LPA) to be consulted, and in Scotland
      and Northern Ireland the regulators will refer to the guidance from the
      Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) which also
      details the need for a LPA.
