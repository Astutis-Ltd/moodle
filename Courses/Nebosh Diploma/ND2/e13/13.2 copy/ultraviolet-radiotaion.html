      UltraViolet Radiation (UVR) has shorter wavelengths and more energetic
      photons (particles of radiation) than visible light.
    </p>
    <p>UVR is sub-divided into three bands, depending on wavelength:</p>

    <p>
      The use of UltraViolet (UV) tanning equipment, such as sunlamps, sunbeds
      and tanning booths, intentionally exposes customers to UV radiation. Staff
      exposure may also be a concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunbed use causes short term damage to the skin (sunburn) and eyes
      (conjunctivitis) and in the longer term gives rise to premature skin
      ageing, skin cancer and cataracts. Exposure before the age of 35 years
      significantly increases the risk of several types of skin cancer, and
      younger people seem to be at greater risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="ast-italic">Sunbeds (Regulation) Act 2010</span> makes it
      illegal for under-18s to use commercial UV tanning equipment. Children
      accompanying adults, who are using UV tanning equipment, should be
      protected against stray UV radiation.

      The following people should be strongly counselled against the use of UV

      The duration of individual sessions should be limited in accordance with

      ensure that cumulative exposure is within manufacturer’s guidelines and
      medical advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      UV tanning equipment should be operated correctly in accordance with
      manufacturers’ guidance. The correct lamps should be fitted and the
      equipment should be set up, calibrated and maintained in accordance with
      the manufacturer’s instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trained staff should be present while customers are using UV tanning
      equipment to provide customers with information about the risks and assist
      as required. Staff should be made aware of the risks to themselves from
      working with UV tanning equipment and how to reduce or avoid these risks.
      Staff training records should be kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      If more than one piece of equipment is operated in the same room screening
      should be provided between the units.
    </p>
    <p>The equipment should be cleaned and sanitised between customers.</p>
    <p>
      UV eye protection (goggles) should be provided for customers and for staff
      when maintaining equipment.
