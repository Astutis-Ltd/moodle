    <p>
      Laser classification relates to the potential hazard of the accessible
      laser radiation in respect to skin or eye damage and does not relate to
      other potential hazards such as electrical, mechanical or chemical
      hazards, or hazards from secondary optical radiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intent of classification is to recognize the increased risk of injury
      (at short distances from the laser) with increasing powers accessible
      above the Class 1 base-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The potential hazard can be greatly reduced by additional user protective
      measures, including additional engineering controls such as protective
      housings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The classification and labelling requirements are laid down in BS EN
      60825-1:2014,
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >‘Safety of Laser Products - Part 1 Equipment classification and
        requirements.’</span

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Class 1</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Laser products that are safe during use, including long-term direct
      intra-beam (within the beam) viewing, even when using telescopic optics.
      Class 1 also includes high power lasers that are fully enclosed so that no
      potentially hazardous radiation is accessible during use (embedded laser
      product).
    </p>
    <p>
      Although ‘eye-safe’ (below the
      <span class="ast-bold">accessible emission limit</span> AEL for Class 1 or
      below the <span class="ast-bold">maximum permissible exposure</span> MPE
      for the eye for the given exposure duration) intra-beam viewing of Class 1
      laser products which emit visible energy may still produce dazzling visual
      effects, particularly in low ambient light.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-italic">Note:</span> A laser that is inherently safe and
      cannot exceed the MPE under any circumstances is exempt from the
      classification system.

      <p>Class 1M</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Class 1M products are safe for the naked eye, even for long-term direct
      intra-beam viewing. The MPE can be exceeded and eye injury may occur
      following exposure with telescopic optics such as binoculars for a
      collimated beam of sufficient (specified) diameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wavelength region for Class 1M lasers is restricted to the spectral
      region where most glass optical materials used in optical instruments can
      significantly transmit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intra-beam viewing of Class 1M laser products which emit visible radiant
      energy may still produce dazzling visual effects, particularly in low
      ambient light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fibre-optic communication systems typically use Class 1M laser products.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Class 1C</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Class 1C products are intended for direct application of laser radiation
      to the skin or internal body tissues for medical, diagnostic, therapeutic
      or cosmetic procedures such as hair removal, skin wrinkle reduction, and
      acne reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the emitted laser radiation may be at Class 3R, 3B or 4 levels,
      ocular exposures are prevented by one or more engineering means.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exposure level of the skin depends on the application, therefore this
      aspect is covered by vertical (product specific) standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-italic">Note:</span> Class 1C was introduced in the 2014
      standard.

      <p>Class 2</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Class 2 products emit visible radiation in the wavelength range from 400nm
      to 700nm that are safe for momentary exposures but can be hazardous for
      deliberate staring into the beam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following factors contribute to preventing injury under reasonably
      foreseeable conditions:

      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The use of optical instruments does not increase the risk of ocular
      injury, however, dazzle, flash-blindness and afterimages may be caused by
      a beam from a Class 2 laser product, particularly under low ambient light
      conditions. This may have indirect general safety implications resulting
      from temporary disturbance of vision or from startle reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Class 2 label instructs users not to stare into the beam, i.e. to
      perform active protective reactions by moving the head or closing the eyes
      and to avoid continued intentional intra-beam viewing.
    </p>
    <p>Some laser pointers and barcode scanners are Class 2 laser products.</p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Class 2M products emit visible laser beams and are safe to the naked eye
      for short time exposure only. The MPE can be exceeded and eye injury may
      occur following exposure with telescopic optics such as binoculars for a
      collimated beam of sufficient (specified) diameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dazzle, flash-blindness and afterimages may be caused by a beam from a
      Class 2M laser product which may have indirect general safety
      implications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such visual disturbances could be of particular concern if experienced
      while performing safety-critical operations such as working with machines
      or at height, with high voltages or driving.
    </p>
    <p>The Class 2M label instructs users:</p>

      Some lasers used for civil engineering applications, such as level and
      orientation instruments are Class 2M laser products.

      <p>Class 3R</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Class 3R products emit radiation that can exceed the MPE under direct
      intra-beam viewing, but the risk of injury in most cases is relatively
      low.
    </p>
    <p>
      The AEL for Class 3R is limited to 5 times the AEL of Class 2 (visible
      laser radiation) or 5 times the AEL of Class 1 (non-visible laser
      radiation).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the reduced risk the required control measures are less than
      for Class 3B. Although Class 3R laser products are not intrinsically safe,
      the risk is limited because:

    <p>
      The risk of injury increases with exposure duration, and exposure may be
      hazardous for ocular exposure under worst-case conditions or for
      intentional direct intra-beam viewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the varying range of the risk that is associated with Class 3R
      lasers, the applicability of specific user controls (including
      administrative controls and personal eye protection) should be clearly
      described in the user instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dazzle etc is a concern as for a Class 2 laser under low ambient light
      conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Class 3R lasers should only be used where direct intra-beam viewing is
      unlikely.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Class 3B</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Class 3B products are normally hazardous when intra-beam ocular exposure
      occurs (i.e. within the nominal ocular hazard distance / NOHD) including
      accidental short time exposure. Viewing diffuse reflections is normally
      safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Class 3B lasers which approach the AEL for Class 3B may produce minor skin
      injuries or even pose a risk of igniting flammable materials. However,
      this is only likely if the beam has a small diameter or is focussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of Class 3B products include lasers used for physiotherapy
      treatments and many research lasers.

      Laser products for which intra-beam viewing and skin exposure is hazardous
      and for which the viewing of diffuse reflections may be hazardous. These

      Lasers used for many laser displays, laser surgery and cutting metals may
