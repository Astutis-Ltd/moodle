      <h5>Notifiable Non-Licensed Works (NNLW)</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->

    <p>
      From April 2012, some non-licensed work, where the risk of fibre release
      is greater, is subject to notification of work. This is known as
      Notifiable Non-Licensed Work (NNLW).
    </p>
    <p>
      Most work with firmly bonded materials in good condition such as asbestos
      cement, bitumen, plastic, resin, rubber, roofing felt, paper linings,
      cardboard, textiles, gaskets, washers and rope etc. will not need to be
      notified.
    </p>

    <p>
      Short duration ‘maintenance’ work involving Asbestos Insulation Board
      (AIB) in good condition will also not normally need to be notified.
    </p>
    <p>
      To determine whether or not work is NNLW the following needs to be
      considered:

      Following consideration of these elements, the decision flow chart below
      can be used to help determine whether the work is licensable and / or
      notifiable.

      Asbestos essentials is a task manual for building, maintenance and allied
      trades on how to safely carry out non-licensed work involving asbestos. It
      was originally published as a guidance booklet (HSG10) and is now
      available as a series of forty plus downloadable task sheets from the HSE
      website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheet A0, ‘Advice on non-licensed work with asbestos’, provides an
      introduction to the asbestos essentials’ task sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheet EM1, ‘Equipment and Method 1’, outlines procedures on what to do
      materials that may contain asbestos are uncovered or damaged in the
      workplace, as shown at the bottom of this page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should asbestos be found in a building, there is a sequence of events to
      be followed:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Multilevel Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Keep people out of the affected area
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">Seal it off</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Reduce air flow through the area by shutting down any ventilation and
          air conditioning systems
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Place signs at the entrance to the area warning of possible asbestos
          contamination
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          If contractors or employees have been contaminated with dust follow
          decontamination and waste disposal procedures
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Take a sample of the material and send it for analysis to check if it
          contained asbestos:
          <div class="ast-list-second">
            <ul class="ast-list__bullet-second">
              <li class="ast-list__bullet__item-second">
                If the response is negative, no further action will be necessary
              </li>
              <li class="ast-list__bullet__item-second">
                If the analysis confirms the presence of asbestos, it might be
                necessary, depending on the scale of the operation, to engage a
                licensed contractor to take the necessary remedial action and
                undertake clean-up operations
              </li>
              <li class="ast-list__bullet__item-second">
                This would then require additional controls for the operation
                e.g. the erection of polythene sheeting to contain the asbestos
                during the work, wearing appropriate protective clothing,
                damping down and double bagging any board that was removed and
                disposing of it by means of a licensed carrier to a waste site
                licensed to receive it.
