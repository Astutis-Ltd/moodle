    <p>
      A written (electronic or paper) management plan should be prepared to set
      out how the risks identified from asbestos will be managed. Details should
      include:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          identifying the person(s) responsible for managing the asbestos risk
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          a copy of the asbestos record or register and how to access it if it
          is kept electronically
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          instructions that any work on the fabric of the building cannot start
          without the relevant parts of the record / register being checked.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The plan should include details for how this will be achieved through
      procedures and arrangements to ensure that:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the record / register is checked in good time before the work starts
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          checks are made to ensure that the information on the presence of
          asbestos has been understood and will be taken into account
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          checks are made that competent asbestos-trained contractors will carry
          out the work and that the correct controls will be used
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          plans are in place for any necessary work identified from the risk
          assessment requiring repair, protection or removal of ACMs
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          monitoring the condition of ACMs is properly scheduled
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

          asbestos risk management is not available.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>The action plan should:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          prioritise the actions identified
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          give high priority to damaged material and materials likely to be
          disturbed; these will need to be repaired, sealed, enclosed
          protectively or removed using trained and competent personnel.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      If unsure how to implement the management plan themselves, the dutyholder
      should seek competent specialist advice from an asbestos surveyor, a
      laboratory or a licensed contractor, or other competent person as
      appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan should include procedures and responsibilities to ensure that the
      asbestos register is shared with any worker / contractor carrying out
      maintenance or other work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The asbestos register, including drawings, should be available on site for
      the entire life of the premises and should be kept up to date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Work should only start once the dutyholder is satisfied that the
      information in the asbestos record / register is known and understood by
      the workers who are doing the work on site and easily accessible for
      anyone who needs to inspect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple asbestos management plan is generally presented in four sections:
