    <p>
      A ‘management survey’ (workplace inspection is conducted to identify where
      asbestos is located or where there might be asbestos in the workplace.
      This is recorded in the asbestos record (asbestos register).
    </p>
    <p>
      The HSE recommends that each entry in the asbestos register should be
      given a material score and a priority score. ACM’s in good condition score
      ‘1’ for both material and priority.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HSE’s ‘Material and priority scoring tool’ is used to get material and
      priority scores for materials in poor condition. The highest risk
      materials (blue asbestos) and highest risk conditions (unsealed / not
      encapsulated / significant damage etc) score 3, with an intermediate score
      of 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scores for each asbestos material should be recorded in the asbestos
      register.
    </p>
    <p>
      The asbestos register must be kept current and should be updated following
      any work done on asbestos materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      All materials in the register should be checked at least once a year to
      make sure they haven’t deteriorated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employees and contractors should be informed and regularly reminded of the
      need to check the asbestos register before undertaking any works which may
      disturb asbestos materials. Systems should be in place to ensure that the
      work is authorised by a manager or supervisor and that the necessary
      checks are made.
