    <p>
      The dutyholder is any person who by virtue of a contract or tenancy has an
      obligation (of any extent) regarding the maintenance or repair of
      non-domestic premises or the means of access to or egress from those
      premises. This is typically the occupier, landlord or managing agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there are no contracts or tenancy agreements for any parts of the
      premises, every person who has, to any extent, control of that part of the
      premises or its means of access or egress is a duty-holder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there is more than one duty-holder, the relative contribution of
      each towards complying with the requirements of this regulation is
      determined by the nature and extent of the maintenance and repair
      obligation owed by that person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every person must cooperate with the dutyholder so far as is necessary to
      enable the duty-holder to comply with their duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to manage the risk from asbestos the duty-holder must take all
      reasonable steps to ensure that a suitable and sufficient assessment is
      carried out as to whether asbestos is, or is liable to be, present in the
      premises.
    </p>
    <p>The assessment must consider:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the condition of any asbestos which is, or has been assumed to be,
          present in the premises
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          building plans or other relevant information
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">the age of the premises and</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          include an inspection (asbestos survey) of all parts of the premises
          which are reasonably accessible.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The dutyholder must ensure that the assessment is reviewed without delay
      if there is reason to suspect that the assessment is no longer valid or
      there has been a significant change to the premises.
    </p>
    <p>The conclusions of the assessment and every review must be recorded.</p>
    <p>
      Where the assessment shows that asbestos is or is liable to be present in
      any part of the premises, the dutyholder must ensure that:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the risk from the asbestos is determined
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the measures which are to be taken for managing the risk are specified
          in a <span class="ast-bold">written plan</span> identifying those
          parts of the premises concerned.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The measures to be specified in the plan for managing the risk must
      include adequate measures for monitoring the condition of any asbestos or
      any substance containing or suspected of containing asbestos. The asbestos
      / asbestos containing materials must be properly maintained, or where
      necessary, safely removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information about the location and condition of any asbestos or asbestos
      containing materials (the asbestos register) is provided to every person
      liable to disturb it, and the emergency services, as necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dutyholder must ensure that the asbestos management plan is reviewed
      and revised at regular intervals, and without delay if:

    <p>The measures taken to implement the plan must be recorded.</p>
