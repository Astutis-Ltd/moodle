    <p>There are two types of survey for Asbestos Containing Material (ACM):</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">A management survey</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          A refurbishment / demolition survey.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>The management survey</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The purpose of the ‘management survey’ is to ensure that ACM are
      effectively managed during the normal occupation and use of premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      In simple and straightforward premises the survey may be undertaken by the
      duty holder, otherwise, a surveyor should be employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The survey must locate ACM that could be damaged or disturbed by normal
      activities, by foreseeable maintenance, or by installing new equipment. It
      will involve minor intrusion and disturbance of presumed ACM.
    </p>
    <p>
      The survey will confirm the condition of ACM and establish whether any
      remedial works are necessary. It also informs the asbestos register and
      should be used to prevent future accidental disturbances of ACM.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>The refurbishment / demolition survey</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The refurbishment / demolition survey is required where the premises, or
      part of it, need upgrading, refurbishment or demolition. The survey
      involves destructive inspection and sampling of ACM and must identify all
      ACM before any structural work begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The area to be surveyed must be vacated for the survey, and certified as
      ‘fit for reoccupation’ after the survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any ACM require sealing, encapsulation or removal a licensed contractor
      must be used, unless the materials are lower risk (for example: asbestos
      cement) then an unlicensed but competent contractor may undertake the
      work.
