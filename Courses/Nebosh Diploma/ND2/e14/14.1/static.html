            <td class="ast-table__ctn__wrp__row">
              When maintaining a posture or making a movement, the joints ought
              to be kept as far as possible in a neutral position. In the
              neutral position the muscles and ligaments which span the joints
              are stretched to the least possible extent, and are thus subject
              to less stress.

            </td>
            <td class="ast-table__ctn__wrp__row">
              If the work is too far from the body, the arms will be
              outstretched and the trunk bent over forwards. The weight of the
              arms, head and trunk, added to the weight of any load, exerts a
              greater horizontal leverage, placing the joints of the elbow,
              shoulder and back under stress.

            <td class="ast-table__ctn__wrp__row">
              An adultâ€™s upper body weighs approximately 40kg. The further the
              trunk is bent forwards, the harder it is for the muscles and
              ligaments of the back to maintain the upper body in balance. The
              stress is particularly large in the lower back.

            </td>
            <td class="ast-table__ctn__wrp__row">
              Twisted postures of the trunk stretch the elastic discs between
              the vertebrae, and subjects the joints and muscles on both sides
              of the spine to asymmetric stress.

            </td>
            <td class="ast-table__ctn__wrp__row">
              Sudden movements and forces can produce large, short-duration
              stresses. Peak stresses are a consequence of acceleration in the
              movement.

            <td class="ast-table__ctn__wrp__row">
              Prolonged postures and repetitive movements are tiring, and can

              Continuous stress, as a result of a prolonged posture or
              repetitive movement, leads to localised muscle fatigue, muscular
              discomfort and reduced muscle performance.
