                Acute trauma occurs when a sudden force is applied to the back
                and spine, for example: from attempting to lift an excessive
                load very rapidly, or tripping whilst carrying a load and
                utilising fast twisting movements with the load to regain
                balance.
              </p>
              Injury can occur to the vertebrae, inter-vertebral discs, the
              muscles, tendons and ligaments associated with the back.

                Chronic stress is essentially a collection of minor injuries,
                each resulting in damage, and not being fully repaired before
                the next damage occurs. The muscles, tendons, ligaments and
                inter-vertebral discs may all be affected.
              </p>
              Chronic stress occurs from: poor handling techniques, adopting
              poor postures, poor muscle condition, and repetitive load bearing
              movements.

                Muscle sprains occur when the muscle fibres become damaged. This
                damage can have a biomechanical and / or chemical cause.
              </p>
              <p>
                Biomechanical damage can occur through over extension of the
                muscle, or by operating above the muscle’s safe load operating
                capacity and prolonged high intensity use.
              </p>
              Chemical damage can cause sprain when there is a decrease of
              oxygen in the cell, as a result of prolonged exertion by the
              muscle or impeded blood flow to the muscle.

                The body becomes weaker and more susceptible to damage as part
                of the ageing process. Ageing results in:

              <p>
                A prolapsed disc can be caused by a single event, but is more
                likely to be caused by an accumulation of factors over time.
              </p>
              A prolapsed disc occurs when the nucleus ruptures through the
              fibrous material surrounding it. If this gel traverses in the
              direction of the spinal cord, or an associated base nerve, then it
              will apply pressure, compressing the nerve, and causing back pain.
