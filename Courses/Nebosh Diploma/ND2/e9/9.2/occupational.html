      <p>

    <p>
      Occupational hygiene is concerned with the prevention of ill-health from
      work, through recognising, evaluating and controlling the risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occupational hygienists have an important part to play in ensuring
      occupational health, through their role in identifying, assessing and
      controlling health hazards in the workplace. They specialise in
      controlling health risks in practical and cost-effective ways, by
      assessing and resolving practical problems in a wide range of settings,
      including factories, offices and building sites. They concentrate on short
      and long-term effects on health arising from both acute and chronic
      exposure, and enable organisations to respond effectively to legislative
      requirements. The practice of occupational hygiene has contributed
      significantly to the promotion of health in the workplace.
