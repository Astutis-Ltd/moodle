      A direct reading instrument may be used, for example: a Draeger tube, or
      an impinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The illustration below shows a midget impinger which contains a liquid
      through which the contaminated air being sampled is bubbled, for example:
      acid mist through water.
    </p>
    <p>
      This method is not used frequently as the contents of the impinger can
      spill out and contaminate the operator.

    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The advantage of passive sampling is that no pump is required, which means
      it is much easier for operatives, and sampling can take place over a
      number of shifts if necessary. The ability to carry out long-term sampling
      is particularly useful for gases such as nitrous oxide sampled over days
      or weeks.
    </p>
    <p>The illustration below shows the following methods:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The <span class="ast-bold">badge sampler</span> has a flat permeable
          membrane supported over a shallow layer of sorbent
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The <span class="ast-bold">tube sampler</span> has a smaller permeable
          membrane supported over a deep tube filled with sorbent.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Sampling starts when the cover of the badge or the end of the tube is
      removed. The contaminant diffuses through the sample medium at a
      calculated rate and then the samples are sent to the laboratory for
      analysis for a TWA concentration to be calculated.

    <p>
      In general, the Regulatory Authorities have been reluctant to accept
      diffusive monitoring methods, due to concern about accuracy. This is
      centred around calculating the precise volume of contaminated air, which
      will differ with wind speed (drafts) and will affect the amount of
      material absorbed onto the sampling medium.

      Chemical analysis requires a packed tube or sampling head with a filter
      impregnated with an adsorbing material, for example: charcoal or silica,
      is attached to a pump. After sampling it is desorbed and analysed in a

      There are a range of analytical techniques involving spectrometry,
      spectroscopy and chromatography that can be used to identify specific
      substances and their concentration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is one of the most common and widely used
      spectroscopic techniques due to its usefulness in determining structures
      of compounds and identifying them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC / MS) is an instrumental
      technique, comprising a gas chromatograph (GC) coupled to a mass
      spectrometer (MS), by which complex mixtures of chemicals may be
      separated, identified and quantified.

      <p>Direct reading instruments</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Direct reading instruments can be used to give a continuous reading of
      levels of a specific gas or vapour in the atmosphere. Some will also
      calculate time-weighted averages for comparison to Long-Term Exposure
      Limits (LTEL) and Short-Term Exposure Limits (STEL).
    </p>
    <p>
      Portable instruments are available for measuring levels of oxygen, carbon
      monoxide, hydrogen sulphide, chlorine, and other gases. These are often
      used for monitoring gas levels in confined spaces. Some instruments will
      monitor for combinations of three or four gases. These ‘three in one’ or
      ‘four in one’ multi-gas instruments, continually measure oxygen level,
      flammable gas and one or two toxic gases such as carbon monoxide and / or
      hydrogen sulphide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equipment will normally give an alarm if dangerous levels of oxygen or
      toxic gas are encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar equipment may be used as monitoring equipment for static sampling
      in some industries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Explosimeters are used to indicate the levels of flammable gas or vapour
      in air, and will be set to raise the alarm well in advance of reaching
      flammable or explosive levels.
