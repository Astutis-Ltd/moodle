      When the risk to employees is being adequately controlled, the data
      obtained from the initial appraisal or more comprehensive survey, showing
      individual or group exposure, can be used as the basis for preparing a
      routine air monitoring programme, designed to monitor the effectiveness of
      control measures. The aim of this programme of monitoring would be to
      ensure that the control measures stay effective.

      Occupational hygienists will be needed to carry out quantitative
      monitoring. There are a series of HSE publications aimed at the
      occupational hygienist, laboratory analysts, etc. These are called the
      ‘Methods for the Determination of Hazardous Substance’, MDHS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MDHS may be
      <span class="ast-bold">general or substance specific</span>, for example:

      Where available, the substance specific methods should be used over the
      general MDHS.

      The frequency of routine surveys will vary. The nearer the measured
      exposure is to the WEL, the more frequent monitoring will be required.

          Schedule 5 of the CoSHH Regulations specifically requires continuous
          monitoring for exposure to vinyl chloride monomer, and monitoring
          every 14 days for sprays given off from vessels during electroplating
          processes.

      All routine monitoring results should be compared with previous monitoring
