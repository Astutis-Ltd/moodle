      There are no specific legal requirements for an occupational hygienist’s
      report, however, as a minimum the report should contain the facts, and may
      contain some opinion.

      To assist the reader it is useful to explain the background and why the
      occupational hygienist’s report was needed (the purpose), the terms of
      reference under which the report was commissioned and what information was
      provided, for example: reported symptoms or improvement notice etc. Also
      the date(s) of visit(s) and the site(s) visited should be clearly
      identified.

      Where a survey of an area, plant or process is conducted the following
      should be described in the report:

      Conclusions should also be drawn about adequacy of control and any further

      <span class="ast-bold">Recommendations</span> should be selected using the
