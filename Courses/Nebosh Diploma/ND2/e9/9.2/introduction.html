      Traditionally some employers have managed health hazards reactively, i.e.
      when an employee has an adverse heath reaction, action is taken to reduce
      further risk. Unfortunately, once symptoms appear there may be permanent
      ill-health.

      The focus of the CoSHH regulations is to prevent ill-health, i.e. to
      assess risk before exposure and to monitor the workplace to ensure
      controls are adequate.

      Airborne sampling is important, as inhalation is the route of entry to the
      body causing most ill-health. It is also important because it checks risk
      factors are controlled before the onset of symptoms.
