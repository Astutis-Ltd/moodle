          Inhalation may not be the sole route of entry into the body. Some
          substances have the ability to penetrate intact skin and become
          absorbed into the body, thus contributing to systemic toxicity

          The doses received by workers may vary depending upon, for example,
          their work rate. A higher work rate will cause workers to breathe more
          deeply and inhale more air. This is not taken into consideration
          during standard settingâ€¦ but must be taken into account during CoSHH
          assessment

          Working conditions may impose additional stress on the body, for
          example: high temperatures, pressures and humidity may increase the
          toxic response to a substance
