    <p>In the UK WELs are set at levels which are either:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The level at which
          <span class="ast-bold">no adverse effects on human health</span>
          (NOAEL – see below) would be expected to occur based on the known and
          / or predicted effects of the substance...
        </li>
        <p style="margin: 20px 0 10px 0">
          ...or if this is not reasonably achievable...
        </p>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          ...a level corresponding to what is considered to represent
          <span class="ast-bold">good control</span>, taking into account the
          severity of the likely health hazards and the costs and efficacy of
          control solutions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">NOAEL</span> (No Observed Adverse Effect Level) is
      the <span class="ast-bold">highest</span> point on the exposure response
      curve where there are no adverse health effects observed in humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      This value is important in assessing the exposure / response relationship
      (or dose / response relationship) of the substance in humans, i.e. the
      toxicology. If this level of exposure is achievable in the workplace, ‘so
      far as is reasonably practicable’, then the Workplace Exposure Limit (WEL)
      will be proposed at this level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dose response relationship is not suitable for all substances, for
      example, there are no absolute safe levels for carcinogens, mutagens and
      respiratory sensitisers. A low exposure could lead to severe ill-health.
      This is why the WEL would then be based at a level corresponding to what
      is considered to represent good control, taking into account:/p>

      <!--List Bullet Start-->

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the severity of the likely health hazard
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the costs and efficacy of control solutions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Wherever possible the Workplace Exposure Limit (WEL) would not be set at a
      level where there is evidence of adverse effects on human health.
