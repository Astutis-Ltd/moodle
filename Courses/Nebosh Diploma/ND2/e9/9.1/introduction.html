      Workplace Exposure Limits (WELs) are Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs)
      set under the CoSHH Regulations in order to help protect the health of
      workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A WEL is the maximum concentration of an airborne substance averaged over
      a reference period, to which employees may be exposed by inhalation.

      <h5>The history of Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs)</h5>

    <p>
      Few limits for occupational chemical exposure were developed until 1912,
      when a list of 20 acute exposure limits was published in Germany. During
      the 1940s America’s focus was turned to preventing injury and disease in
      the workplace, and an effort undertaken to understand and define ‘harmful
      exposures’ to substances. The American Conference of Governmental
      Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) published its first list of 148 ‘Maximum
      Allowable Concentrations’ (MACs) of air contaminants in 1946.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically, there has been some degree of commonality in the nature of
      experiences in setting and using health-based Occupational Exposure Limits
      (OELs) in the European Union. The European Union continues to play a
      significant role in standardising OEL setting across member countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      These similarities, however, do not entirely override national differences
      in the setting of Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) in different member
      states.
    </p>
    <p>
      Europe now sets
      <span class="ast-bold"
        >Indicative Occupational Exposure Limit Values</span
      >
      (IOELVs), health-based limits set under the Chemical Agents Directive (98
      / 24 / EC). The Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits
      (SCOEL) advises the European Commission on limits. This committee
      evaluates the scientific information available on hazardous substances and
      makes recommendations for the establishment of an IOELV. IOELVs are then
      listed in Directives, which require Member States to establish national
      occupational exposure limits for the chemical agents in question, taking
      into account the European values.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases, this will mean that the British workplace exposure limit
      (WEL) will be identical, or very close, to the IOELV.
