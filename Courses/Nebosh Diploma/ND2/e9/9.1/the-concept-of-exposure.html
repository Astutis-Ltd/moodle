    <p>
      Some illnesses caused by exposure to hazardous substances in the workplace
      (occupational diseases), may not appear until a long time after the first
      exposure. Therefore, it is important to know in advance how to protect the
      health of people working with hazardous substances, and also of other
      people who may be affected by the work being carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some substances therefore have exposure benchmarks, such as
      <span class="ast-bold">Workplace Exposure Limits (WELs)</span> or other
      exposure standards. These can provide useful guidance in indicating how
      stringent control measures need to be. If people are potentially exposed
      to, for example, 100 times the appropriate benchmark standard, then the
      performance of the control measures will need to be much greater than if
      the potential exposure was only twice the benchmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The degree to which exposure should be reduced below this standard will
      depend on a number of factors. These include the:

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          severity of the harm being prevented
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the likelihood that harm will occur
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the degree of uncertainty associated with the standard.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Sometimes control measures may be selected which reduce exposure more than
      is strictly necessary. Usually this occurs because some controls are more
      convenient and acceptable. For instance, people may prefer to wear air-fed
      RPE rather than filtering devices, although the protection offered by a
      filter facemask may be adequate.

            >The HSE has established Workplace Exposure Limits (WELs)</span
          >
          for a number of substances hazardous to health. These are intended to
          prevent excessive exposure to specified hazardous substances by
          containing exposure below a set limit. These WELs are published by the
          HSE in EH40 / 2005 Workplace exposure limits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Workplace Exposure Limits (WELs) should not be considered a hard and
          fast line between safe and unsafe. WELs are not true thresholds of
          toxic effect, they are intended to allow an ‘acceptable risk.’ The
          principles require the degree to which exposure is reduced below the
          WEL to be proportionate to the health risk. If employers apply the
          principles of good practice for the control of substances hazardous to
          health correctly,
          <span class="ast-bold">exposure should be below any relevant WEL</span
          >.
