    <p>
      In 2005 the
      <span class="ast-italic">Control of Substances Hazardous to Health</span>
      (CoSHH) <span class="ast-italic">Regulations</span> were updated and made
      a major change in the UK approach to Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs):
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The CoSHH updates introduced a new type of limit, ‘Workplace Exposure
          Limits’ (WELs), which are not to be exceeded, to replace the
          previously used ‘Maximum Exposure Limits’ (MELs) and ‘Occupational
          Exposure Standards’ (OESs)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          CoSHH required assurance that exposure to substances, that could cause
          occupational asthma, cancer, or damage to genes passed down from one
          generation to the next, were reduced ‘as low as reasonably
          practicable’.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The first requirement of CoSHH is to prevent exposure to substances
      hazardous to health ‘so far as is reasonably practicable’. Where
      prevention is not reasonably practicable adequate controls must be
      implemented.
    </p>
    <p>Control of exposure to substances hazardous to health is adequate if:</p>

      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The principles of good practice set out in schedule 2A of CoSHH (see
          later and Element 5) have been applied

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">WELs have not been exceeded</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Exposure is reduced to as low a level as is reasonably practicable
          for:

                respiratory sensitisers or any other substance which the risk

    <p>
      To achieve this all possible routes of exposure should be considered and
      control measures provided, which are proportionate to the risk and
      regularly reviewed. It is also important that employees are given
      information, instruction and training on the risks involved and the
      control measures to be followed. In cases where there is no approved
      Workplace Exposure Limit (WEL), an in-house standard should be set.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a WEL is exceeded there may be something obviously wrong which can be
      corrected. If the reasons for the excessive exposure are not obvious, a
      more detailed investigation may be needed.

    <p>
      If the working exposure is less than 8 hours, the Long-Term Exposure Limit
      (LTEL) may be exceeded in proportion to the hours worked, as long as the
      Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL) is never exceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice, employees’ exposure will differ over an 8 hour period,
      depending on their tasks, breaks, etc. The illustration below shows how a
      typical 8 hour exposure may look.

    <p>
      Some dusts have a specific Long Term Exposure Limit (LTEL), for example:
      silica dust. However, where there is no Workplace Exposure Limit (WEL)
      assigned, dust may still be harmful, especially if it is respirable, i.e.
      enters the alveoli. In this case CoSHH sets the WEL for ‘nuisance dust’
      Long Term Exposure Limit (LTEL) as:
