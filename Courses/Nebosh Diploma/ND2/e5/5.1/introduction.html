      This element looks at the roles and relationships between three pieces of
      legislation REACH, CLP and CoSHH. The relevant aspects are discussed in
      more detail later.

      <p>REACH</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      REACH is the European Union Regulation for the Registration, Evaluation,
      Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals. REACH was designed to fill the
      knowledge gaps around the safety of chemicals used every day in industry
      and in consumer products.
    </p>
    <p>
      It takes a broad view of chemical use, and places new duties on businesses
      depending on where they sit in the supply chain. ‘Registration’ requires
      companies who manufacture chemical substances or import them into Europe
      (i.e. those at the top of the European supply chain) to ‘register’ a
      dossier of technical information about each substance they manufacture or
      import above a tonne a year with the ECHA in Helsinki.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distributors and suppliers have specific duties to pass information
      (Safety Data Sheets) down to their customers, and also to pass information
      back to their own suppliers when customers ask them to do so, thus
      overlapping with CLP
    </p>
    <p>
      Businesses that use chemicals in their work have a duty to use chemicals
      safely in accordance with the information on risk management measures that
      has been passed down the supply chain in labels and SDS, and in accordance
      with specific workplace legislation such as CoSHH.
    </p>

      <p>CLP</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The EU Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation entered
      into force in January 2009, and introduced a method of classifying and
      labelling chemicals based on the United Nations’ Globally Harmonised
      System (GHS). Consistent classification and labelling helps to ensure that
      the hazards presented by chemicals are clearly communicated to workers and
      consumers.

      The
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1999</span
      >
      requires employers to control substances that are hazardous to health. A
      basic understanding of the Regulations is assumed knowledge. This element
      revisits the details of Regulations 6 and 7, the assessment of health
      risks created by work involving substances hazardous to health; and the
      prevention or control of exposure to substances hazardous to health.
