      <span class="ast-bold">DNEL </span> stands for ‘derived no effect level’.
      The DNEL represents a level of exposure above which humans should not be
      exposed. OELs exist only for few substances but under REACH derived
      no-effect levels (DNELs) will be achievable for the majority of substances
      registered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">CMR </span> are high-risk substances: carcinogens,
      mutagens, and those that are toxic for reproduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Chemical Safety Assessment </span> is part of the
      REACH registration package and is an assessment of a substance’s hazards,
      uses and recommended risk reduction methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Competent Authority. </span> The role of competent
      authority in the UK will be delegated to the HSE. The HSE and Environment
      Agency will have significant roles, with valuable assistance from other
      government bodies e.g. DEFRA.

      <span class="ast-bold">Exposure scenario</span> means the set of
      conditions, including operational conditions and risk management measures,
      that describe how the substance is manufactured or used during its
      life-cycle and how the manufacturer or importer controls, or recommends
      downstream users to control, exposures of humans and the environment.
      These exposure scenarios may cover one specific process or use, or several
      processes or uses, as appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">PNEC</span> stands for ‘predicted no effect
      concentration’. The PNEC represents the concentration of a chemical in any
      environmental compartment below which unacceptable effects will most
      likely not occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Restriction</span> means any condition for or
      prohibition of the manufacture, use or placing on the market under REACH.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">SVHC</span> (‘substances of very high concern’) are
      substances that have hazards with serious consequences for human health or
      the environment, e.g. they have the potential to cause cancer, or they
      remain in the environment for a long time with their amounts in animals
      gradually building up. The ‘candidate list’ of SVHC is published on the
      website of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).
