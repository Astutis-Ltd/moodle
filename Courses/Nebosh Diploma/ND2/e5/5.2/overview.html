      <h5>The registration process</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The fundamental principle of the registration requirement can be
      summarised as: <span class="ast-bold">‘No data, no market’.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is estimated that there are around 30 000 substances on the European
      Market in quantities of 1 tonne or more per year. To accommodate the
      registration of those substances which were already being manufactured or
      supplied their registration is taking place in three phases, spread over
      11 years. This part of the process is referred to as
      <span class="ast-bold">pre-registration.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Registration is a requirement on manufacturers and importers to collect
      and collate specified sets of information on the properties of those
      substances they manufacture or supply at or above 1 tonne per year. This
      information is used to perform an assessment of the hazards and risks that
      a substance may pose and how those risks can be controlled. This
      information and its assessment is submitted to the European Chemicals
      Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Joint registration and data sharing</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      For any one substance, a single set of information on its intrinsic
      properties is produced and shared by all those companies that manufacture
      or supply that substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Business specific (e.g. company name) and business sensitive (e.g. how it
      is used) information is submitted separately by each company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Companies that work together to get an agreement on information sharing
      through the Substance Information Exchange Forum (SIEF), and submit joint
      registrations, benefit from a reduced registration fee.
    </p>

    <!--H2 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h2">
      <h5>Evaluation</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Dossiers submitted in support of registration are subject to evaluation
      under REACH as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Compliance checking:</span> This is a check of the
      quality of the information submitted by industry. It is undertaken by the
      ECHA and is based on a sample of at least 5% of dossiers submitted at each
      tonnage level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Dossier Evaluation:</span> For substances
      registered at the highest tonnage levels (≥100 tonnes / annum) a proposal
      is made by the registrant detailing those animal tests they consider are
      required from the list of standard tests in Annexes IX and X of REACH. The
      ECHA will evaluate these testing proposals to prevent unnecessary animal
      testing. (discussed in Section 2.4).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Substance evaluation:</span> This is undertaken by
      national Competent Authorities on substances that have been prioritised
      for potential regulatory action because of concerns about their hazardous
      properties. A key regulatory outcome of evaluation could be the imposition
      of
      <span class="ast-bold"
        >‘restrictions on the manufacture, supply or use of a substance’.</span
      >
      Substance evaluation may also lead to a substance being added to the
      priority list for authorisation or a proposal to change the classification
      and labelling.
