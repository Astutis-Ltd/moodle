      Although the EU had a legal framework for controlling the manufacture and
      supply of chemicals in the 1960s the strategy for a modern chemicals
      policy was first published in a White Paper on the
      <span class="ast-italic">Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy,</span> in
      2001. This was realised with the REACH Regulation for the Registration,
      Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals which came into force on the 1
      June 2007.

    <p>REACH aims to:</p>

      REACH applies to substances manufactured or imported into the EU in
      quantities of 1 tonne or more per year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, it applies to all individual chemical
      <span class="ast-bold">substances</span> on their own, in
      <span class="ast-bold">preparations</span> or in
      <span class="ast-bold">articles</span> (if the substance is intended to be
      released during normal and reasonably foreseeable conditions of use from
      an article).

        <p>
          A chemical element and its compounds in the natural state or obtained
          by any manufacturing process, including any additive necessary to
          preserve its stability and any impurity deriving from the process
          used, but excluding any solvent which may be separated without
          affecting the stability of the substance or changing its composition.

        <p>A mixture or solution composed of two or more substances.</p>

        <p>
          An object, which during production is given a special shape, surface
          or design, which determines its function, to a greater degree than
          does its chemical composition. Examples of articles are a car, a
          battery and a telephone.
