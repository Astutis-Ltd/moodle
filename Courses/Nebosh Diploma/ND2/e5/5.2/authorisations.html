          In order to place on the market or use substances with properties that
          are deemed to be of
          <span class="ast-bold">‘very high concern’</span> industry must apply
          for an authorisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A company wishing to market or use such a substance must submit an
          application to the ECHA for an authorisation. Decisions on
          authorisation are made by the European Commission, taking advice from
          the ECHA and member states.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applicants have to demonstrate that risks associated with uses of
          these substances are adequately controlled or that the socio- economic
          benefits of their use outweigh the risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applicants must also analyse whether there are safer suitable
          alternatives or technologies. If there are then they must prepare
          substitution plans and if not then they should provide information on
          research and development activities if appropriate.

              SVHCs are hazardous substances that have serious consequences,
              e.g. they cause cancer
              <span class="ast-bold">(carcinogenic),</span> or they have other
              harmful properties and remain in the environment for a long time

    <p>
      Any substance that poses a particular threat that is deemed to require
      Community-wide action can be restricted. Restrictions range from a total
      ban to a prohibition on supply to the general public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Restrictions can be applied to any substance, including those that do not
      require registration.

      <h5>Information in the supply chain</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The passage of information up and down the supply chain is a key feature
      of REACH. Users should be able to understand what manufacturers and
      importers know about the dangers involved in using chemicals and how to
      control risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      REACH adopts and builds on the previous system for passing information -
      the Safety Data Sheet (SDS). The SDS should accompany materials down
      through the supply chain, providing the information users need to ensure
      chemicals are safely managed, handled and used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information on the hazardous properties of a substance based on
      classification by characteristics is provided on labels required by the
      CLP regulation which dovetails with REACH.
