    <p>
      Following the UKâ€™s withdrawal from the EU and the subsequent transition
      period, the EU REACH Regulation has been brought into UK law under the
      European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
      REACH, and related legislation, have been replicated in the UK with the
      necessary changes to make it operable in a domestic context. The key
      principles of the EU REACH Regulation have been retained. The new domestic
      regime is known as UK REACH.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of 1 January 2021 the UK REACH and the EU REACH regulations operate
      independently from each other. Companies that supply and purchase
      substances, mixtures or articles to and from the EU/EEA/Northern Ireland
      and Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) will need to ensure that
      the relevant duties are met under both pieces of legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the Northern Ireland Protocol the EU REACH Regulation continues to
      apply to Northern Ireland, while UK REACH will regulate the access of
      substances to the GB market.
