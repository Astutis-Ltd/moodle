    <p>
      CLP uses a signal word to highlight the danger level. The new signal word
      has two levels:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Danger - those substances and mixtures with the most severe hazards
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Warning - those substances and mixtures with less serious hazards.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      <span class="ast-italic">Note:</span> In some case no signal word is
      required for a hazardous chemical.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Hazard (H) statements</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Hazard statements replace the previously used risk phrases, and provide
      more information about the type of hazard involved. Some H statements may
      be used for more than one hazard category within a hazard class, and
      therefore the H statements alone do not describe the classification – the
      hazard class and category also need to be mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>Example H statements include:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">H240</span> – Heating may cause an explosion
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">H320</span> – Causes eye irritation
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">H401</span> – Toxic to aquatic life.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Precautionary (P) statements</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Precautionary statements replace the previously used safety phrases and
      give advice on preventive measures to take, emergency response actions
      such as first aid and advice on safe storage and disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally there will be a maximum of six P statements on the label, unless
      the chemical is particularly hazardous. Other relevant P statements may be
      included in the safety data sheet for the chemical.
    </p>
    <p>Example P statements include:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">P102</span> – Keep out of reach of children
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">P271</span> – Use only outdoors or in
          well-ventilated area
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">P410</span> – Protect from sunlight.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>GB CLP</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      As of the 1st January 2021, the European Union (EU) CLP Regulation was
      replaced in Great Britain by retained EU law – the GB CLP Regulation. This
      arrangement mean that Great Britain continues to adopt GHS, independently
      of the European Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order for GB CLP to operate fully and effectively in Great Britain, the
      EU CLP Regulation has been amended. This means there are changes to the
      requirements or allowances in existing processes and procedures.
    </p>
    <p>
      All existing EU harmonised classification and labelling in force on 31
      December 2020, are retained in Great Britain as GB mandatory
      classification and labelling (GB MCL).
    </p>
    <p>
      The GB CLP Regulation applies to GB-based manufacturers, importers,
      downstream users and distributors supplying the GB market.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HSE becomes the relevant GB CLP Agency overseeing GB CLP functions for
      substances and mixtures placed on the GB market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Substances and mixtures placed on the market in Northern Ireland remain
      subject to the EU CLP Regulation.
