      The CLP Regulation entered into force in January 2009, and introduced a
      method of classifying and labelling chemicals based on the United Nations’
      Globally Harmonised System (GHS). As of 1 June 2015 the CLP Regulation
      replaced the CHIP Regulations in the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chemical classification is used to regulate the supply and use of
      chemicals. In some cases classification can act as the basis for requiring
      additional chemical controls, protective measures, or restrictions on sale
      (under REACH) or use (under CoSHH).

    <p>
      In most case the supplier needs to decide on the classification of a
      substance or mixture. Self-classification of a substance or a mixture is
      based on a four step process:

    <p>
      If the nature and severity of an identified hazard meets the
      classification criteria in Annex I to the CLP Regulation, a certain hazard
      class will be assigned to the substance or mixture. There are hazard
      classes for physical hazards, health hazards, and environmental hazards.
    </p>
    <p>Note: Hazard classes are discussed in Section 2.4.</p>

    <p>
      In some cases (e.g. to protect human health or the environment), the
      decision on the classification of a chemical is taken at Community level.
      It is mandatory for the suppliers of the respective substance or mixture
      to apply this harmonised classification and labelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process often concerns the most hazardous substances. These are
      usually carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic for reproduction or respiratory
      sensitisers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The list of harmonised classifications (covering around 8 000 commonly
      used substances) can be found in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 of Annex VI to the CLP
      Regulation.
