    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The level of exposures requires CoSHH risk assessments to consider what
      substances are likely to be present and in what form, e.g. dust, vapour,
      mist, fume etc. and in what concentration.

    <p>
      Routes of entry include: inhalation, skin contact, ingestion, exposure
      through the eyes and ears, and injection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The route of entry is directly related to the physical form of the
      chemical. Airborne chemicals will be available to the breathing zone,
      pastes will cause skin contact etc.

    <p>
      The physical property for solids is a subjective assessment of the
      material’s ‘dustiness’. CoSHH Essentials uses simple descriptors of
      dustiness to put a substance into a high, medium or low dustiness band:

      Where a task is likely to generate an aerosol from a liquid, there is also
      a significant increase in the exposure potential. Aerosols are formed by:

    <p>
      The volatility of a substance is a measure of the tendency of that
      substance to vapourise. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) are substances
      that can evaporate at normal temperature and pressure and therefore
      present a particular risk. The lower the boiling point, the more vapour
      will be available and the higher the risk.

        <p>
          The concentration of a substance can be expressed in terms of the mass
          of a given substance per volume of solution, or space.
        </p>
        <p>
          In laboratory work concentration is typically measured in grams per
          cubic decimetre (g dm-3).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another common unit of concentration is volume percent or
          volume-volume percent (v / v%). Where v / v% = [(volume of solute) /
          (volume of solution)] x 100%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Increasing the concentration of a chemical generally increases the
          rate of a chemical reaction, and in this context the effect on human
          health.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example sulphuric acid in >15% solution is corrosive; between 5%
          and 15% is irritant; and at &lt;5% is not hazardous to tissue.

    <p>
      The solubility of a substance (i.e. whether or not it dissolves in water
      or fat [lipid]) will determine both the route of the substance into the
      human body and the tissues in which it will accumulate. Should it
      accumulate in sufficiently high concentrations the effects will be toxic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus for example water soluble compounds of lead are found (amongst other
      places) in the red blood cells, while fat soluble ones concentrate in the
      Central Nervous System (CNS).

    <p>
      A task involving a physical job which produces a large amount of dust e.g.
      chipping away lead from stained glass windows, will produce a greater
      exposure.

      <p>The number of people exposed</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The risk assessment will need to consider the ways in which and the extent
      to which any groups of people could be exposed, including maintenance
      workers who may work in circumstances where exposure is foreseeably higher
      than normal: office staff, night cleaners, security guards, members of the
      public such as visitors, patients etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minimising the number of people exposed is a key part of the hierarchy of
      control. The more people exposed the greater the need to use collective
      measures, i.e. controlling the hazardous substance at source, rather than
      individual measures.

      <p>Type and duration of exposure</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The dose of substance received is the product of the concentration to
      which workers are exposed and the duration of exposure. Therefore,
      reducing the exposure time will reduce the dose received. This can be
      achieved by job rotation.
    </p>
    <p>
      An estimate of exposure will also need to take into account the effort
      needed to do the work and how this may affect the rate and volume of air
      employees breathe (for some work activities, employees might breathe three
      or four times the volume of air that they would breathe at rest).
