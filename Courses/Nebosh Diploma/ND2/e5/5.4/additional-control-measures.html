      In all circumstances, exposures should be prevented or adequately
      controlled by measures other than personal protective equipment (PPE), so
      far as is reasonably practicable, in the light of the degree of exposure,
      circumstances of use, informed knowledge about the hazards of the
      substance and current technical developments.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, PPE such as gloves, coats etc., and respiratory protective
      equipment (RPE) in particular, may be used as secondary protection in
      combination with other control methods, if those methods do not adequately
      control exposure by themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the use of PPE and clothing is unavoidable, such as during a plant
      failure or maintenance operations, it will be necessary to follow the
      guidance on the standards for PPE, and the considerations that apply to
      the use of RPE (see Element B3 Section 2).
