      CoSHH Regulation 7 requires every employer to ensure that the exposure of
      his employees to substances hazardous to health is either
      <span class="ast-bold">prevented</span> or, where this is not reasonably
      practicable, <span class="ast-bold">adequately controlled.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Substitution</span> is the preferred solution –
      replacing a hazardous substance with a substance or process which, under
      the conditions of its use, either eliminates or reduces the risk to the
      health of his employees so far as is reasonably practicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where prevention of exposure is not reasonably practicable the employer
      should adequately control exposure levels by applying appropriate
      protection measures in the following order of priority:

      Several controls may need to be used in concert to ensure an adequate
      level of overall control. Where this is necessary it is essential to
      insure that the controls work well together, especially for controls at
      levels 5, 6 and 7.
