    <p>
      The employer is required to make a suitable and sufficient assessment of
      the risks to his employees’ health arising from workplace exposure to
      substances hazardous to health.
    </p>
    <p>
      For less significant risks the CoSHH assessment can be made as part of, or
      as an extension of, the more general risk assessment duties placed on
      employers by Regulation 3 of the Management Regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application of the ‘five steps’ approach for a basic hazardous
      substances assessment is shown below.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the hazardous substance is flammable, explosive or oxidising the
      assessment can also be used to fulfil the requirements of the
      <span class="ast-italic">Dangerous Substances</span> and
      <span class="ast-italic">Explosive Atmosphere Regulations 2002</span>
      (DSEAR).
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of the assessment is to enable the employer to make a valid
      decision about the measures necessary to prevent or adequately control the
      exposure of their employees to substances hazardous to health arising from
      the work.
