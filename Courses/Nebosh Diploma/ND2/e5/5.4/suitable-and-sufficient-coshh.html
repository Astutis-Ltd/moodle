    <p>
      The assessment should determine whether there are any substances hazardous
      to health (including biological agents) at the workplace to which
      employees are liable to be exposed, and in a form in which the substance
      can be inhaled, ingested or absorbed through the skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assessment of the risks created by any work must be
      <span class="ast-bold">comprehensive</span> and take into account those
      substances, which are:
    </p>

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Brought into the workplace and handled, stored and used for processing
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Produced or given off (as fumes or vapour dust, for example) by a
          process or an activity, or as a result of an accident or incident
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Used for, or arise from maintenance, cleaning, and repair work
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Produced at the end of any process, such as: wastes, residues, scrap
          etc.
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Produced from activities carried out by another employer’s employees
          in the vicinity.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      For those hazardous substances brought into and used in the workplace, the
      employer’s first priority is to prevent exposure to the substance by
      identifying and substituting a non-hazardous or less hazardous
      alternative. This should be a thorough and comprehensive process which:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          companies consider and evaluate the hazards posed by any alternative
          substances that are available and the degree of risk they may present
          in the work activity concerned
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          results in the employer selecting for use the substance that produces
          the least risk for the circumstances of the work.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Where a substance is a known or suspected carcinogen or mutagen, there is
      a more compelling reason for the employer to make every effort to
      substitute a non-carcinogenic or non-mutagenic alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assessment of the risks created by the work activity should also
      include consideration of:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Multilevel Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

          Where those substances are likely to be present and in what form, for
          example: dust, vapour, mist, fume etc. and whether they are used or
          produced, and in what amounts and how often
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The ways in which and the extent to which any groups of people could
          be exposed, including maintenance workers who may work in
          circumstances where exposure is foreseeably higher than normal: office
          staff, night cleaners, security guards, members of the public such as
          visitors, patients etc., taking into account the type of work and
          process, and any reasonably foreseeable deterioration in, or failure
          of, any control measure provided
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The need to protect particular groups of employees who may be at an
          increased risk, for example: inexperienced trainees and young people
          aged under 18, pregnant workers, disabled workers, and any employees
          known to be susceptible to certain illnesses such as dermatitis,
          asthma or other diseases which may be caused by exposure to hazardous
          substances
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          An estimate of exposure, taking into account any information that may

                The effort needed to do the work and how this may affect the

              <li class="ast-list__bullet__item-second">
                The effect of any engineering measures and systems of work
                currently used for controlling potential exposure. To complete
                the assessment, it may be necessary to carry out atmospheric
                sampling and measurement to determine exposure, particularly
                where operations are complex or specialised and the substances
                involved have an occupational exposure limit
              </li>
              <li class="ast-list__bullet__item-second">
                How the estimate of exposure compares with any existing, valid
                standards which represent adequate control, for example: a
                Workplace Exposure Limit (WEL) or Biological Monitoring Guidance
                Value (BMGV).

    <p>
      Particular consideration should be given to activities which can give rise
      to the highest exposures, for example: cleaning of equipment, work in
      confined spaces, or non-routine or end-of-shift tasks. Understanding the
      factors that contribute to employees’ exposure will help employers decide
      how to control it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a comparison of the estimate of exposure with any existing valid
      standards, which represent adequate control, shows that control is likely
      to be inadequate then the assessment should also describe the extra steps
      needed to obtain and maintain adequate control, for example: better
      enclosure and extraction.
