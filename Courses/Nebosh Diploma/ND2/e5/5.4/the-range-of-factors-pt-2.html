      Where a work activity may expose employees to more than one substance
      hazardous to health, the possible enhanced harmful effects of combined or
      sequential exposures must be considered. Information is usually available
      in section 10 of Safety Data Sheets: ‘Stability and Reactivity’.
    </p>
    <p>There may be a number of effects:</p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Additive effects:</span> The combined effect
      <span class="ast-bold">equals</span> the sum of the effects of each
      chemical alone e.g. 1 + 1 = 2 e.g. organophosphate pesticides, such as
      parathion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Synergistic effects:</span> The combined effect is
      <span class="ast-bold">larger</span> than the sum of the effects of each
      chemical alone e.g. 1 + 1 = 40.
    </p>
    <p>
      An example of an increase in risk is with asbestos fibres and cigarette
      smoking. They act together: the risk of developing lung cancer after
      exposure to asbestos fibres is forty times greater for a smoker than for a
      non-smoker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another pair of the chemicals where the combined risk is greater than a
      mere additive effect are the solvents trichloroethylene and styrene.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Antagonistic effects:</span> The combined effect is
      <span class="ast-bold">less</span> than the sum of the effects of each
      chemical alone e.g. 1 + 1 = 0. This effect is used to find an
      <span class="ast-bold">antidote to a poison.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Potentiating effects:</span> A chemical that
      normally has no effect will <span class="ast-bold">increase</span>
      the effect that another chemical would have alone e.g. 0 + 1 = 3 e.g. two
      commonly used solvents isopropanol and carbon tetrachloride have this kind
      of joint effect. Isopropanol, at concentrations which are not harmful to
      the liver, increases the liver damage caused by carbon tetrachloride.

      <p>Activities causing high exposure</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      It is important to give particular consideration to activities which can
      give rise to the highest exposures, e.g. cleaning of equipment, work in
      confined spaces, or non-routine or end-of-shift tasks. Understanding the
      factors that contribute to employees’ exposure will help decide how to
      control it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is particularly important for repair or maintenance work involving the
      opening of vessels or breaking into pipework to be carried out under the
      control of a ‘permit-to-work’ system. For this work, identifying the
      hazardous substances in a container or pipe is one essential element of
      the risk assessment that must be carried out before the work starts. To
      carry out suitable and sufficient assessments of the work in these
      circumstances, a system must be in place, which identifies:

      An accident, incident or emergency could cause a high exposure to a
      hazardous substance. CoSHH defines such an event as one which causes, or
      threatens to cause, any employee to be exposed to one or more hazardous
      substance on a scale, or to an extent, well beyond that associated with
      normal day-to-day activity. For example, any one of the following events
      may be sufficient to trigger the emergency actions considered by CoSHH:

    <p>
      The threshold limit of a chemical substance is a level to which it is
      believed a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime
      without adverse health effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The threshold limit is an estimate based on the known toxicity in humans
      or animals of a given chemical substance, and the reliability and accuracy
      of the latest sampling and analytical methods. It is not a static
      definition since new research can often modify the risk assessment of
      substances and new laboratory or instrumental analysis methods can improve
      analytical detection limits.

      Effective procedures should be used to ensure that control measures,
      including items of personal protective equipment and any other measure,
      are properly used or applied and are not made less effective by other work
      practices or by improper use. The procedures should include:

    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      It is also essential to ensure that every element of a control measure
      performs as originally intended, and continues to adequately control the
      exposure of employees to substances hazardous to health. This includes the
      identification of any significant deterioration in any element of the
      control measure, and the taking of any necessary corrective steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frequency of any checks carried out will depend on the likelihood of
      significant deterioration of that particular element of the control
      measure and its importance. As a minimum it should be done at intervals of
      not more than one year and after any incidents.

      Anyone who checks the effectiveness of any element of a control measure
      should have the competence to do so. The degree of theoretical and
      practical knowledge required will increase with the likelihood of control
      failure, the seriousness of the consequences, and the complexity of the
