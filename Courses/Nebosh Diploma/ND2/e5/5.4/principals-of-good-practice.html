    <p>
      The objective of the CoSHH Regulations is to prevent, or adequately
      control, exposures to substances hazardous to health, so as to prevent
      ill-health.
    </p>
    <p>
      It places a responsibility on employers to manage and minimise the risks
      from work activities. Employers must develop suitable and sufficient
      control measures and ways of maintaining them. To be effective in the
      long-term, control measures must be practical, workable and sustainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principles of good practice are outlined in Schedule 2A of the CoSHH
      Regulations (p87) and should be applied in
      <span class="ast-bold">all</span> circumstances and a combination of
      controls will often be necessary to best protect the health of employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      These principles are <span class="ast-bold">not</span> presented in order
      of rank (with the most important first) – here the first principle is not
      more important than the last, although there is a logic to their overall
      order of presentation.
    </p>
    <p>The principles of good practice are:</p>

    <p>
      It is more effective, and usually cheaper, to reduce the emission of a
      contaminant at the source, rather than to develop ways of removing the
      contaminant from the workplace, once it has been released and dispersed.
      Sources of exposure should be reduced in number, size, emission or release
      rate, as much as possible. It is often not possible to obtain adequate and
      reliable control unless this is done. Both the processes and procedures
      need to be considered. To identify how people get exposed during work
      activities, it is essential to recognise the principal sources and how the
      contaminant is transferred within the workplace. It is easy to miss
      significant sources and causes of exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is best to do this at the design stage, but it may well be possible to
      make useful and relatively low-cost changes to existing processes.
      Identify and control the worst sources first.
    </p>
    <p>
      People working near a process may be significantly exposed even though
      those directly involved are protected, for example: by wearing PPE. In
      these circumstances, the most practical option may be to segregate the
      process. It may be the only viable way to protect those people not
      directly involved in the process or activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the number and size of sources have been minimised, consider reducing
      emissions by enclosure or other means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Design work methods and organisation to minimise exposure. This normally
      requires clearly defined and described work methods. Organise the work to
      minimise the number of people exposed and the duration, frequency and
      level of exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV) is an important option for controlling
      exposure. Apart from considering the process to be controlled, the LEV
      should be designed so that it is easy to use correctly. LEV hood design
      should be compatible with the system of work and the operator’s
      requirements, such as lighting and heating.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to identifying significant sources, it is essential to
      identify and consider all work groups that may be exposed. It is easy to
      miss or underestimate the exposure of those engaged in non-routine
      activities, such as work done by maintenance personnel and contractors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, it is important to be aware of, and have contingency plans for
      dealing with, failures of control and emergencies.
