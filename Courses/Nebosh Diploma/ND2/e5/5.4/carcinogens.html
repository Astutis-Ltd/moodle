      <span class="ast-bold">Carcinogens</span> are chemicals that may cause
      cancer or increase its incidence and that bring about changes in the
      makeup of cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Mutagens</span> are chemicals that induce heritable
      genetic defects or increase their incidence.

      <span class="ast-bold">Asthmagens</span> (respiratory sensitisers) are

      Exposure to hazardous substances should be reduced in proportion to the
      health risks. The consequences of exposure to asthmagens, carcinogens and
      mutagens are potentially so severe and there is limited scientific
      knowledge on safe levels exposure should always be reduced ‘as
      <span class="ast-bold">low</span> as is reasonably practicable’.

    <p>
      The first objective is to prevent exposure to carcinogens or mutagens.
      Carcinogenic or mutagenic substances should not be used or processed if
      they can be substituted using a non-hazardous or less hazardous
      substitute. However, the carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic and other
      properties of possible chemical substitutes should be taken into account
      when considering changes.

      It may be possible to choose synthetic routes for the production of

          avoid if possible the formation of by-products, intermediates, wastes

      <p>Control of exposure (Regulation 8)</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      If use of a safer alternative substance or process is not reasonably
      practicable, it will be necessary to achieve and maintain adequate control
      of exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      To reduce exposure ‘as low as is reasonably practicable,’ for substances
      with an 8-hour long- term WEL reference period, a programme of air
      monitoring may have to be carried out. This will generally be necessary
      unless the risk assessment shows that the level of exposure is most
      unlikely ever to exceed the WEL.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extent to which the level of exposure should be reduced below the WEL
      depends on the type of risk presented by the substance, weighed against
      the cost and the effort involved in taking measures to reduce the risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      For carcinogens or mutagens, it is particularly important that control of
      exposure is kept to as low a level as is reasonably practicable. This is
      because of the high risk of death associated with many forms of cancer,
      and the fact that the level of exposure affects only the probability of
      cancers occurring in any exposed population, not the severity of the
      disease in individuals.
