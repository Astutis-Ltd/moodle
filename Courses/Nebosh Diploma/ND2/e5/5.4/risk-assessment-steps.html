    <p>
      The assessment should consider the ways in which and the extent to which
      any groups of people could be exposed taking into account the type of work
      and process, and any reasonably foreseeable deterioration in, or failure
      of, any control measure provided. Groups to be considered include:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Groups of employees who may be at an increased risk should also be
      considered, for example:

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">Disabled workers</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Any employees known to be susceptible to certain illnesses such as
          dermatitis, asthma or other diseases which may be caused by exposure
          to hazardous substances.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Employee exposure should be estimated taking into account any information
      that may be available about:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The concentration likely to be produced by the work concerned
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The effort needed to do the work and how this may affect the rate and
          volume of air employees breathed (breathing rate for energetic work
          can be 3-4 times greater than the resting rate)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The effect of any existing preventive or control measures.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Where operations are complex or specialised and the substances involved
      are available to the breathing zone with a Workplace Exposure Limit (WEL),
      air sampling and measurement may be necessary to effectively determine
      exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The estimate of exposure should then be compared with any existing, valid
      standards, which represent adequate control, for example: a WEL.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a comparison shows that control is likely to be inadequate then the
      assessment should detail the measures needed to obtain and maintain
      adequate control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Control measures should be applied in accordance with the principles of
      good practice (see Element B2).

      <p>4) Record the findings and implement them</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      A record of the significant findings should present an effective statement
      of hazards and risks, and the actions taken to protect the health of
      employees and anyone else that may be affected by the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The record provides evidence that all the factors relevant to the work
      have been systematically considered, and that measures have been
      implemented to prevent exposure or to achieve and maintain adequate
      control of exposure.

      The assessment should be reviewed regularly with the frequency of review
      determined by the type of risk, the work and the likelihood of changes

    <p>
      The assessment should be reviewed immediately if there is evidence
      indicating it may no longer be valid, or a significant change in the
