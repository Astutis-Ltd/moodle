    <p>
      The physical, chemical and infectious properties of a substance have a
      great bearing on which route of exposure, or combination of routes, is
      most important.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, it might be immediately obvious that not all routes apply,
      for example: for people exposed to crystalline silica, the only relevant
      route of entry is by inhalation. Whereas, for work at room temperature
      with a low volatility substance, such as dimethyl formamide, the primary
      route of entry will be through the skin. Therefore:
    </p>

      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">

        </li>

          rank these routes in order of importance.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Where inhalation is the most relevant route, the main focus for control
      will be sources of emission to air. Where the main concern is ingestion or
      effects on, or as a result of penetration through the skin, then the main
      focus for control will be sources of contamination of surfaces or clothing
      and direct contamination of the skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exposure assessments should identify and, if at all possible, grade or
      rank the contribution of all routes of exposure (inhalation, skin and
      ingestion) to total exposure. In this way control effort can be directed
      at the main sources and causes of exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prevent skin contact where possible if contamination may lead to skin
      absorption, ingestion or direct health effects on the skin. Regularly
      clean all surfaces that can become contaminated. The frequency of cleaning
      should be based on the rate at which the surfaces become contaminated and
      how often skin is likely to come into contact with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the workroom is likely to become contaminated, and this contamination
      may contribute significantly to exposure, people should not increase their
      exposure by activities, for example: eating, drinking, smoking, or using
      cosmetics in the workplace.

    <p>
      The more severe the potential health effect and the greater the likelihood
      of it occurring, the stricter the measures required to control exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the health effects arising from exposure are less serious, for example:
      simple, reversible irritation, and are not likely to cause long-term harm,
      it may be sufficient to reduce exposure by simple, low-cost measures such
      as replacing lids on vessels or cleaning work areas regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the health effects arising from exposure are more serious, for
      example: cancer, asthma, allergic dermatitis, severe disease or other
      irreversible and disabling health effects, and there is not enough
      information to establish a no-effect level (biological agents will not
      have a no- effect level), then exposure will need to be reduced to low
      levels (see Element B1 section 5). The control measures necessary might be
      extensive, take time to develop and implement, and be relatively costly.
      The measures should control the risk of both long-term (chronic) and
      short- term (acute) health effects.

          Personal protective equipment. The protection afforded by PPE is
          dependent upon good fit, attention to detail and correct use by an

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Changing the process so that less of the hazardous substance is

      The key message is that there is a hierarchy of reliability of control

        Where exposure cannot be controlled by other means, provide PPE with

      Giving people PPE such as gloves or respirators may appear to be the
      quick, cheap and easy option. In practice, it is likely to be the least
      reliable and effective option. It may not actually be the cheapest if a
      PPE programme is compared like-for-like with the cost of providing other
      control options.
    </p>
    <p>
      PPE tends to be less effective and reliable than other control options,
      because it:

      Once an effective set of workable control measures have been devised, they
      need to be put in place and managed. This includes training all relevant
      people in the use and maintenance of the control measures. The requirement
      for maintenance is important to achieve effective and sustained control.
    </p>
    <p>Maintenance of control measures includes:</p>

      Any hardware involved must be checked and must continue to function as
      intended. A similar approach needs to be taken to check the actions people
      must take and the methods of working they need to adopt. If necessary,
      these need correcting too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effectiveness of control measures should be checked regularly. Exactly
      what checks should be done will depend on:

      For control measures to be effective, people need to know how to use them
      properly. Most importantly, people need to know why they should work in a
      certain way and use the controls as specified – they need to be motivated.
    </p>
    <p>
      People also need to know how to recognise when control measures are not
      working properly. This means training operators, and also supervisors and
      managers.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Ensure that control measures do not increase the overall risk</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Process changes, enclosures, ventilation, new methods of working, PPE and
      other changes to control exposure can introduce new risks, for example:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Process changes might mean that equipment cannot be fully
          decontaminated before maintenance staff are given repairs to do
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          New methods of working may create risks of musculoskeletal injury.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      People designing control measures should look for these ‘new’ risks and
      minimise them. They must not only focus on the risk from substances
      hazardous to health. A good control solution is one which minimises the
      health risk, while reducing maintenance burdens, being relatively
      fool-proof, and not introducing other risks.
