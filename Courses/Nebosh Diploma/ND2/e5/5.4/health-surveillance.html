    <p>
      Employers need to be aware of the objectives of health surveillance and
      its limitations in the case of carcinogenic or mutagenic substances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health surveillance has its limitations in identifying people at risk or
      in detecting signs of cancer early enough for treatment to aid a full
      recovery. For this reason, it is largely restricted to keeping health
      records, though skin cancer is a good example where appropriate health
      surveillance can detect the condition at an early stage when it can be
      cured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health surveillance is appropriate where employees are exposed to
      carcinogenic or mutagenic substances, unless the employer assesses that
      exposure is so adequately controlled that there is no reasonable
      likelihood of an identifiable disease or adverse health effect resulting
      from the exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there is evidence from safety data sheets, risk phrases on labels
      etc. that a substance is known to cause, or is suspected of causing,
      cancer of the skin, for example: arsenic, coal soot, coal tar, non-solvent
      refined mineral oils, contaminated used mineral oils, health surveillance
      should include:
