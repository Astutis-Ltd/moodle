      The risk of cancer from exposure to a hazardous substance cannot in most
      cases be presumed to be reduced to zero except by eliminating exposure.
      Furthermore, the adverse effects may not show in the short term. It is,
      therefore, especially important that information, instruction and training
      provided is of an appropriately high standard. It is essential to ensure
      that employees are aware not only of the need to maintain control of
      exposure, but also the additional compounding risks due to smoking.
      Smokers appear to face an increased risk of occupational cancer, since
      they take a mixture of substances into their lungs with the smoke.
