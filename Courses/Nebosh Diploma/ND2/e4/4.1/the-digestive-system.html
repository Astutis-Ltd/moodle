    <p>
      The primary function of the digestive system is to break down food both
      mechanically and by the use of enzymes, so that it can be used by the body
      for energy and cell growth and repair. The human digestive system consists
      of a large number of organs and processes. These have the combined
      functions of breaking down our food into smaller molecules (used to
      produce energy and for other nutritional purposes) and excreting waste
      consumed and produced by the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Digestion essentially occurs in a series of tubes such as the oesophagus
      and intestines as food passes through the body. A number of other organs
      contribute to digestion by providing enzymes for the breakdown of food.
      The anatomy of the digestive system can be seen in the image below.

    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Mouth:</span> the mouth is the starting point of
      digestion. Here the process of chewing starts to break down food and
      enzymes such as salivary lipase and amylase also start to chemically break
      down the food.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Oesophagus:</span> once swallowed the food moves
      into the oesophagus where continual waves of involuntary contraction push
      the food into the stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Stomach:</span> the stomach has both a mechanical
      and a chemical function in digestion. The upper part of the smooth stomach
      muscle relaxes to allow a large volume of food to be stored. The lower
      muscle then contracts in a rhythmical manner in order to churn the food
      inside and mix it together with the gastric acid (mainly hydrochloric
      acid) and digestive enzymes: pepsin, gelatinase, gastric amylase and
      lipase, which break it down further. The stomach then empties its contents
      (called chyme) into the small intestine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Small intestine:</span> the small intestine
      comprises the duodenum (the short first section where digestion takes
      place) and the ileum (a much longer section where absorption occurs). The
      pancreatic duct and bile duct join with the duodenum releasing digestive
      enzymes and bile into it. Bile neutralises the pH of the acidic chyme from
      the stomach and emulsifies fats, creating the ideal environment for the
      pancreatic enzymes to break down fats, starches, proteins and
      polypeptides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the food is completely broken down into its individual components it
      is absorbed through the intestinal walls, into the blood flow of the
      capillaries, which surround the intestine. To make this process faster and
      more efficient the intestinal walls contain numerous folds, which are
      covered in finger-like projections called villi. This vastly increases the
      surface area of the intestine wall for molecules of digested food to pass
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peristalsis, the rhythmic contraction of smooth muscle, moves digesting
      food through the small intestine to the large intestine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Large intestine:</span> the large intestine
      continues the foods journey and is the bodies last chance to absorb any
      water and minerals still remaining. The rest of the contents of the large
      intestine are waste such as indigestible pieces of food and fibre. This is
      passed through to the rectum where it is stored until the bowels are
      opened.
