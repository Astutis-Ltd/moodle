      The skin is the body’s largest organ, covering the entire outside of the
      body and weighing approximately 3 kilos. In addition to serving as a
      protective shield against heat, light, injury, and infection, the skin
      also:

      Throughout the body, the skin’s characteristics vary (i.e., thickness,
      colour, texture). For example, the head contains more hair follicles than
      anywhere else, while the soles of the feet contain none. In addition, the
      soles of the feet and the palms of the hands have much thicker layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skin is made up of the following layers, with each layer performing
      specific functions:

                The epidermis is the thin outer layer of the skin. The epidermis
                itself is made up of three sub-layers:

                  This layer contains continually shedding, dead keratinocytes
                  (the primary cell type of the epidermis). The keratin, a
                  protein formed from the dead cells, protects the skin from
                  harmful substances

                  <span class="ast-bold">Basal layer:</span> The basal layer is
                  the inner layer of the epidermis, containing basal cells.
                  Basal cells continually divide, forming new keratinocytes and
                  replacing the old ones that are shed from the skin’s surface.

              The epidermis also contains melanocytes, which are cells that
              produce melanin (skin pigment).

                The dermis is the middle layer of the skin. The dermis is made
                up of the following:
              </p>

              <!--List Bullet End-->

              The dermis is held together by a protein called collagen, made by
              fibroblasts (skin cells that give the skin its strength and
              resilience). This layer also contains pain and touch receptors.

              The subcutis is the deepest layer of skin and is also known as the
              subcutaneous layer. The subcutis, consisting of a network of
              collagen and fat cells, helps conserve the body’s heat while
              protecting other organs from injury by acting as a ‘shock
              absorber.’

    <p>
      The skin is partially permeable and substances that are soluble in water
      or fat may migrate or be absorbed through the skin and enter the blood
      stream. Hazardous substances may also enter via cuts or abrasions.
