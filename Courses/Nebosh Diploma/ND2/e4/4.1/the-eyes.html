    <p>
      Light waves from an object enter the eye first through the cornea, which
      is the clear dome at the front of the eye. The light then progresses
      through the pupil, the circular opening in the center of the coloured
      iris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fluctuations in incoming light change the size of the eye’s pupil. When
      the light entering the eye is bright enough, the pupil will constrict (get
      smaller), due to the pupillary light response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, the light waves are bent or converged first by the cornea, and
      then further by the crystalline lens (located immediately behind the iris
      and the pupil), to a point located immediately behind the back surface of
      the lens. At that point, the image becomes reversed (turned backwards) and
      inverted (turned upside-down).
    </p>
    <p>
      The light continues through the vitreous humor, the clear gel that makes
      up about 80% of the eye’s volume, and then to a clear focus on the retina,
      behind the vitreous. The small central area of the retina is the macula,
      which provides the best vision of any location in the retina. If the eye
      is considered to be a type of camera (albeit, an extremely complex one),
      the retina is equivalent to the film inside of the camera, registering the
      tiny photons of light interacting with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the layers of the retina, light impulses are changed into
      electrical signals. Then they are sent through the optic nerve, along the
      visual pathway, to the occipital cortex at the posterior (back) of the
      brain. Here, the electrical signals are interpreted or ‘seen’ by the brain
      as a visual image.
