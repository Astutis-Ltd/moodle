    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Capillaries</span> have very thin walls, which
      allow substances to move through the wall with ease. Capillaries are very
      small, measuring 5–10 micrometres in width, with a comparatively large
      cross-sectional area. This allows a fast and efficient transfer of
      oxygen-carrying red blood cells to the tissues and organs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> The heart</span> consists of four chambers and is
      divided into left and right by a wall of muscle called the septum. The
      right side of the heart consists of an atrium, which receives blood
      returning from the body, and the right ventricle, which then pumps blood
      out to the lungs, via the pulmonary artery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The left side also contains an atrium and a ventricle. The left atrium
      receives the oxygenated blood returning from the lungs and the ventricle
      then pumps this blood around the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the distance which the blood being pumped from the left ventricle
      has to travel, a more forceful contraction is required. For this reason
      the muscular wall of the left side is thicker than that of the right side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The atria and ventricles are separated by valves known as
      atrioventricular, or AV valves. The purpose of these valves is to prevent
      blood from flowing in the wrong direction. Following the movement of blood
      from the atrium, into the ventricle, the AV valve snaps shut which causes
      the first heart sound of the heart beat (often described ‘lub dub’, with
      the closing of the AV valves being the ‘lub’).
    </p>
    <p>
      The ‘dub’ sound is caused by the closing of two other valves, known as the
      Semilunar or SL valves. These are located between each ventricle and the
      artery leaving the heart, and again prevent the blood flowing backwards.
