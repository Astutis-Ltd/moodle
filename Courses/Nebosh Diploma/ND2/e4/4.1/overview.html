      This section begins with an overview of the structure and function of the
      main human anatomical systems and sensory organs. Thereafter the main
      routes and methods of entry of hazardous substances into the human body
      are outlined. The concepts of target organs and target systems; and local
      and systemic effects are then explained. The section concludes with an
      explanation of the body’s innate and adaptive immune system responses.

    <p>
      The function of the human respiratory system is to transport air into the
      lungs and to facilitate the diffusion of oxygen into the blood stream. It
      also receives waste carbon dioxide from the blood and exhales it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The respiratory system consists of the following parts, divided into the
      upper and lower respiratory tracts:

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Mouth, nose and nasal cavity:</span> The function
      of this part of the system is to warm, filter and moisten the incoming
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Pharynx:</span> Here the throat divides into the
      trachea (wind pipe) and oesophagus (food pipe). There is also a small flap
      of cartilage called the epiglottis, which prevents food from entering the
      trachea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Larynx:</span> This is also known as the voice box
      as it is where sound is generated. It also helps protect the trachea by
      producing a strong cough reflex if any solid objects pass the epiglottis.

    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Trachea:</span> Also known as the windpipe this is
      the tube which carries air from the throat into the lungs. It ranges from
      20–25mm in diameter and 10–16cm in length. The inner membrane of the
      trachea is covered in tiny hairs called cilia, which catch particles of
      dust, which are then removed through coughing. The trachea is surrounded
      by 15–20 C-shaped rings of cartilage at the front and side, which help
      protect the trachea and keep it open. They are not complete circles due to
      the position of the oesophagus immediately behind the trachea and the need
      for the trachea to partially collapse to allow the expansion of the
      oesophagus when swallowing large pieces of food.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Bronchi:</span> The trachea divides into two tubes
      called bronchi, one entering the left and one entering the right lung. The
      left bronchus is narrower, longer and more horizontal than the right.
      Irregular rings of cartilage surround the bronchi, whose walls also
      consist of muscle. Once inside the lung the bronchi split several ways,
      forming tertiary bronchi.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Bronchioles:</span> Tertiary bronchi continue to
      divide and become bronchioles, very narrow tubes, less than 1 millimeter
      in diameter. There is no cartilage within the bronchioles and they lead to
      alveolar sacs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Alveoli:</span> Individual hollow cavities
      contained within alveolar sacs (or ducts). Alveoli have very thin walls,
      which permit the exchange of gases Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide. The alveoli
      are surrounded by a network of capillaries, into which the inspired gases
      pass. There are approximately 3 million alveoli within an average adult
      lung.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Diaphragm:</span> The diaphragm is a broad band of
      muscle, which sits underneath the lungs, attaching to the lower ribs,
      sternum and lumbar spine and forming the base of the thoracic cavity.

      <p>The mechanics of breathing</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The action of breathing in and out is due to changes of pressure within
      the thorax, in comparison with the outside. This action is also known as
      external respiration. During inhalation the intercostal muscles (between
      the ribs) and diaphragm contract to expand the chest cavity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Gaseous exchange:</span> The oxygen is carried
      within the red blood cells as oxyhaemoglobin. Following respiratory gas
      exchange between the alveoli and the capillary blood flowing around them,
      oxygenated blood is delivered around the body. The oxygen dissociates from
      the haemoglobin and passes through the capillary wall into the muscle
      cells where it is ‘picked up’ by myoglobin, the muscle cells equivalent to
      haemoglobin. The oxygen can now be used in aerobic metabolism to provide
      the muscle with energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waste product produced during aerobic metabolism is carbon dioxide.
      Due to the lower concentration of carbon dioxide in the capillaries than
      the muscle tissue (especially during high levels of metabolism/activity)
      there is a surge through the capillary wall. From here the blood continues
      into venules and then veins which return the deoxygenated and CO<sub
        >2</sub
      >
      rich blood back to the heart and then on to the lungs where the CO<sub
        >2</sub
      >
      is exhaled and more oxygen is taken up.
