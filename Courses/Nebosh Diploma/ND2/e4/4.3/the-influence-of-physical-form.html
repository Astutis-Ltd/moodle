    <p>
      The physical form of a chemical has a direct effect on the route of entry
      into the body.

    <p>
      Solids are the least likely of the chemical forms to cause chemical
      poisoning. However, certain chemical solids can cause poisoning if they
      get onto the skin or food and can then be ingested. Personal hygiene is
      important to prevent the ingestion of chemical solids.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest danger with solids is that some work processes can change
      them into a more dangerous form, for example: wood that is being cut can
      turn into wood dust, which can then be inhaled. Welding rods can decompose
      into fumes and gases. Polyurethane foam is safe in its normal solid form
      but gives off deadly gases if it burns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chemicals in solid form can give off toxic vapours, which can be inhaled,
      and solids can be flammable and explosive, and/or corrosive to the skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chemicals can change their physical form during work processes which may
      change them into more hazardous materials.

      Dusts are tiny particles of solids. Workers can be exposed to dust in the
      workplace from:

          materials that normally exist in dust form, for example: bags of

    <p>
      The main danger from harmful dusts is that they can be breathed (inhaled)
      into the lungs. When breathed in, the larger dust particles are usually
      trapped by hairs and mucus and then removed by the body. Smaller
      particles, however, are more dangerous because they can get deep inside
      the lungs where they can have damaging effects, or they can be absorbed
      into the bloodstream and travel to other parts of the body where they can
      cause damage.

    <p>
      Particles suspended in air are termed aerosols, the particle size will
      determine how far into the respiratory tract the particle travels.

          Dust is a cloud of solid particles ranging up to 150 micron in
          diameter. Anything over 75 micron is classed as grit and is unlikely
          to remain suspended in the air. A micron = 1 / 1000<sup>th</sup> of a
          millimetre and is abbreviated to μm. A human hair is about 50 micron
          in diameter.

    <p>
      Dusts are usually produced mechanically by grinding, crushing, sanding,
      milling etc., for example: silica, flour, wood dust or general dust.
    </p>
    <p>Dust is divided into two categories depending on size:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">‘Inhalable dust’</span> (sometimes referred to
          as <span class="ast-bold">total inhalable dust</span>) is the total
          dust that will enter the nose and mouth and lungs during breathing
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">‘Respirable dust’</span> is dust of such a size
          that it is able to enter the lower levels of the lung during normal
          breathing (approx. 0.5 to 7.0 micron). Respirable dust is often in the
          form of long particles with sharp edges which cause scarring of the
          lung lining (fibrosis). This limits the capacity of the lungs and,
          therefore, the amount of air in the lungs.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Dusts can also cause eye damage.</p>
    <p>
      One particular problem with dusts is that they can be hard to see. It is
      often not possible to see a cloud of tiny dust particles except with
      special lighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under certain conditions dusts can explode, for example: an explosion in a
      grain silo or flour mill.
