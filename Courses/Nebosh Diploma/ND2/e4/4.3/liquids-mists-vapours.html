    <p>
      Many hazardous substances, for example: acids and solvents, are liquids
      when they are at normal temperature. However, many liquid chemicals give
      off vapours, which can be inhaled and which may be highly toxic, for
      example: volatile organic compounds such as toluene, xylene, isocyanates
      etc., whose boiling point is below room temperature (see ‘vapours’ below).
    </p>
    <p>
      Liquid chemicals can be absorbed by the skin. Some liquid chemicals (such
      as acids) may cause immediate skin damage and they may or may not be
      absorbed into the bloodstream as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other liquids pass directly <span class="ast-bold">through</span> the skin
      into the bloodstream, for example: mercury, where they can travel to
      different parts of the body and cause damaging effects.
    </p>

      <p>Mists</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Mists are tiny droplets of liquid, which are suspended in the air. The
      liquid droplets are created by spraying, pickling, foaming and
      electroplating, for example: a mist created by water from a shower which
      may contain legionella, or an oil mist or an acid mist created when an
      acid solution is boiled. The droplets are less than 20μm in size.
    </p>

      <p>Vapours</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      A vapour is the gas phase of a material, which is normally liquid under
      standard conditions. Many liquid chemicals evaporate at room temperature,
      which actually means that they form a vapour and stay in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vapours from some chemicals can irritate the eyes and skin. There can
      be a variety of serious health effects from inhaling certain toxic
      chemical vapours, for example: rhinitis, asthma, sensitizing asthma,
      dermatitis etc. Vapours can also be flammable or explosive. Mists and
      vapours are often invisible.
    </p>

      <p>Gases</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Some chemical substances are in the form of a gas when they are at a
      normal temperature. However, some chemicals in liquid or solid form
      <span class="ast-bold">become</span>
      gases when they are heated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some gases can easily be detected by their colour or smell, but there are
      other gases that you cannot see or smell at all, i.e. they can only be
      detected with special equipment, for example: carbon monoxide.
    </p>
    <p>Gases can be inhaled.</p>
    <p>
      Some gases produce immediate irritant effects, for example: nitrogen
      dioxide. The health effects of other gases may be noticeable only after a
      person’s health has already been seriously damaged, for example: cyanide.
      Other gases are ‘inert’, they are not poisonous to the body but may cause
      asphyxiation if they replace the oxygen in an enclosed space, for example:
      nitrogen and carbon dioxide.
    </p>
    <p>Gases may also be flammable or explosive.</p>
