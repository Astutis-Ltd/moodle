      When pathogens enter the body, the immune system attempts to destroy them.
      Inside the body, pathogens behave in different ways:

          Viruses reproduce inside cells and damage them and escape to infect

    <p>
      Both cell damage and toxins cause the symptoms of infectious diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="ast-bold">innate (non-specific) immune system</span> is
      the first line of defence against invading micro- organisms. The innate
      immune system exists at birth, and does not change very much through life.
      It responds rapidly to infection, but has neither memory nor any
      specificity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main cells used in the innate system are phagocytes which are
      attracted to an organism, bind to it, engulf it by endocytosis and release
      cytotoxic materials to kill it. Digestive enzymes are then released onto
      the organism. The process is known as phagocytosis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="ast-bold">adaptive (specific) immune system</span>
      produces a slower response than that of the innate immune system, but the
      response is highly specific. Each lymphocyte is antigen specific (an
      antigen is the foreign substance on the surface of an invading organism).
    </p>
    <p>
      The adaptive system has a memory and therefore mounts a fast immune
      response to previously encountered microbes.
    </p>
    <p>The cells of the adaptive immune system are:</p>

      There may be vaccinations available to encourage the development of
      antibodies e.g. Hepatitis A and B vaccinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immunisation is the process of giving dead or weakened forms of the
      disease causing bacteria to a person, usually as an injection. The
      injection does not cause the disease but the immune system responds and
      creates antibodies. Then if the person is infected with the live bacteria
      another time their immune system is ready to kill the bacteria.
