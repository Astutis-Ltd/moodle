    <p>
      The degree of the toxic effect is not the same in all organs. Usually
      there are one or two organs which are most affected. These are referred to
      as target organs of toxicity of the particular substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The central nervous system is the target organ of toxicity most frequently
      involved in systemic effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood circulation system, liver, kidneys, lungs and skin follow in
      frequency. Muscle and bones are the target organs for a few substances.
      The male and female reproduction systems are vulnerable to many
      substances.
    </p>
    <p>
      A target organ is part of the body which sustains an adverse effect when
      it is exposed to, or is contaminated by, a particular harmful substance,
      for example: lungs, brain, kidneys, liver, skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> The skin</span> is the largest organ in the human
      body, 1.5–2 m2 in area. It provides a protective cover to the body but can
      fail if the load is overwhelming. A number of substances can penetrate
      healthy intact skin and enter the blood circulation. Phenol is a substance
      that may even result in death after exposure and penetration through the
      skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast majority of work-related skin diseases are contact eczema,
      irritation and inflammation of the skin. This condition can be either a
      non-allergic or allergic reaction to exposure to chemical substances.
      Several colourants and dyes, metals, for example: nickel and its salts,
      chromium and cobalt salts and organomercuric compounds, monomers of a
      number of acrylates and rubber additives are examples of common contact
      sensitizers. In practice also circumstances, such as humidity and heat,
      influence the formation chemical skin injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> The lung</span> is the major route through which
      toxic substances enter the body in the workplace. It is also the first
      organ to be affected by dusts, metal fumes, solvent vapours and corrosive
      gases. Allergic reactions may be caused by substances such as cotton dust,
      TDI (toluene diisocyanate, used in the manufacture of polyurethane
      plastics or spray painting of cars), and MIC (methyl isocyanate, used in
      production of carbaryl insecticide). In a disastrous chemical accident in
      Bhopal, India, in 1984, more than 2000 people died from exposure to MIC.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allergic reactions may result also from exposure to bacteria or fungi:
      this is the case in allergies from handling stocked hay (`farmer’s lung’)
      or dried sugar cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dust particles of a certain size of some substances are inhaled the
      lungs are unable to remove them. The particles become embedded in the
      lungs causing a condition called pneumoconiosis. Pneumoconiosis is a
      specific problem for workers exposed to the dust of silica (quartz) and
      asbestos, and is the most common non-malignant occupational lung disease
      throughout the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other substances, such as formaldehyde, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides
      and acid mists, may cause irritation and reduce the breathing capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">The nervous system</span> is sensitive to the
      hazardous effects of organic solvents. Some metals affect the nervous
      system, especially heavy metals such as lead, mercury and manganese.
      Organophosphate insecticides such as malathion and parathion interfere
      severely with information transmission (chemical neurotransmitter
      function) in the nervous system, leading to weakness, paralysis and
      sometimes death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">The blood circulation</span> is a target for the
      adverse effects of solvents. Blood cells are mainly produced in the bone
      marrow. Benzene affects the bone marrow, the first sign is mutation in the
      blood cells called lymphocytes. To study mutation, lymphocytes are
      cultured in the laboratory to observe specific types of cellular changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lead, in the form of the metal or its compounds, is another classic
      example of a chemical that may cause blood problems. Lead in the blood may
      inhibit certain enzyme activities involved in the production of
      haemoglobin in red blood cells. Chronic lead poisoning may result in a
      reduced ability of the blood to distribute oxygen throughout the body, a
      condition known as anaemia.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">The liver,</span> the largest of the internal
      organs of the body, has several important functions. It is a purification
      plant which breaks down unwanted substances in the blood. The liver has a
      considerable reserve capacity – symptoms of liver disorder appear only in
      serious diseases. Solvents such as carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and
      vinyl chloride, as well as alcohol, are hazardous to the liver.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">The kidneys</span> are part of the body’s urinary
      system. They have the task of excreting waste products that the blood has
      transported from various organs of the body, of keeping the fluids in
      balance and of ensuring that they contain an adequate blend of necessary
      salts. They also maintain the acidity of the blood at a constant level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solvents may irritate and impair kidney function. The most hazardous to
      the kidneys is carbon tetrachloride. Turpentine in large quantities is
      also harmful to the kidneys: ‘painter’s kidney’ is a known condition
      related to occupational exposure. Other well-known kidney-damaging
      substances are lead and cadmium.
