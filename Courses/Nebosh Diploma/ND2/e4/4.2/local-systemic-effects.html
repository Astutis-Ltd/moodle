    <p>
      Exposure to many occupational hazards causes the body to produce an
      immediate obvious response, called an acute effect. Acute effects often
      disappear soon after the exposure stops and are often reversible, for
      example: the nausea, headache or vomiting a worker might experience after
      using a solvent to clean auto parts. Acute effects can be localised to one
      part of the body, such as a skin reaction from a chemical (an acid, for
      example), but they can also be systemic. If, for example, that chemical
      (such as mercury) also gets absorbed into the bloodstream, there can be
      effects on target organs.
    </p>

      <p>Chronic effects</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Some hazardous substances cause
      <span class="ast-bold">chronic</span> effects, which usually appear a long
      time after the exposure occurred and persist over time. A chronic
      condition usually only appears after a long time because of the diseaseâ€™s
      <span class="ast-bold">latency period</span> (the period of time between
      the exposure and the first sign of disease). Chronic conditions, such as
      many occupational cancers, may take 20 or 30 years to develop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some chronic conditions develop after just a short exposure, whereas other
      chronic conditions only develop after repeated contact with a substance or
      work process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like acute effects, chronic effects can be localised to one part of the
      body, for example: chronic lung disease which develops over years, but
      they can also be systemic.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all diseases, it is better to prevent rather than treat the illness
      once it has developed, but for chronic diseases such as cancer, prevention
      is the only cure. With chronic diseases it is difficult to establish the
      cause of the condition and even harder to get compensation. Thus it is
      important to document all exposures to workers and maintain good records
      for at least 30 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      While exposure to some hazards only causes either an acute or a chronic
      response, exposure to other hazards (example: formaldehyde) can cause both
      kinds of effects. Short-term exposure to formaldehyde may cause headaches
      or eye irritation (acute effects), while long-term exposure may cause
      recurring allergic skin reactions or cancer (chronic effects).

      Local, systemic, acute and chronic health effects can all result from
      exposure to one substance, for example: if a worker drinks too much
