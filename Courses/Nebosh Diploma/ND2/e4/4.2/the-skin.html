      The average adult has 1.6 square metres of skin forming a barrier between
      the body’s internal organs and the outside world. Bacteria and
      micro-organisms cannot pass through unbroken skin, and they are prevented
      from multiplying by the action of oily sebum secreted by the sebaceous
      glands at the root of the hair follicles. Sweat also contains
      antibacterial lactoferrin.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if the skin is broken, by a cut or graze, bacteria and
      micro-organisms can get into the body and the immune system has to send
      white blood cells to kill them. Chemicals are released that cause the area
      to become red, hot and inflamed as blood vessels widen to speed white
      blood cells to the site resulting in blisters, rashes and inflammation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some chemicals can pass through unbroken skin, but only very slowly. Thus
      the nicotine in nicotine patches makes its way into the bloodstream, and
      so do certain toxic chemicals, for example: insecticides and solvents,
      which can then cause systemic ill-health.

      Melanin protects the skin from UV light from the sun and the sensory
      nerves alert the brain to pain.

      Irritant Contact Dermatitis (ICD) occurs when skin comes into direct
      contact with an irritant which damages the outer layer of the skin,
      causing redness, itching, burning or stinging.
    </p>
    <p>
      This may be caused by frequent exposure to a weak irritant, such as soap
      or detergent, or as a consequence of short term exposure to a stronger
      irritant for a short while. People with atopic eczema are at increased
      risk of irritant contact dermatitis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irritants may be chemical, biological, mechanical or physical in nature.
      Wet work (repeated and prolonged contact with water, such as more than 20
      hand washes, or having wet hands for more than 2 hours per shift) can also
      cause irritant dermatitis.

      Allergic Contact Dermatitis (ACD) is caused when the body comes into
      contact with an allergen which causes the immune system to react
      abnormally. During an allergic reaction, the immune system can attack
      healthy cells and tissue causing the skin to become sore and inflamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allergens may be chemical, biological or physical in origin. Contact with
      allergens can arise from immersion of usually the hands, but sometimes the
      legs. It may arise from:

      The first time the body comes into contact with a type of allergen it
      becomes ‘sensitised’ to it. Once someone is ‘sensitised’, it is likely to
      be permanent and any skin contact with that substance will cause allergic
      contact dermatitis.

    <p>Allergens / skin sensitisers can often also have an irritant effect.</p>
    <p>
      Cement can cause both irritant and allergic dermatitis and both types can
      occur simultaneously. Irritant dermatitis is caused by mechanical
      irritation of the skin by cement particles. Allergic dermatitis occurs as
      a result of sensitisation to chromate (hexavalent chromium) in the cement.
      Wet cement is alkaline and can cause serious burns and skin ulcers if
      trapped against the skin.
