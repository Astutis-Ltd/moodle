      The human body has a considerable capacity to excrete, to render dangerous
      substances harmless, and to protect us. However, our defence system can be
      overloaded by repeated heavy exposure so that it no longer fulfils its
      function.

      <p>The respiratory system</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->

    <p>
      The lungs are protected by a series of defence mechanisms in different
      regions of the respiratory tract. The way the respiratory system responds
      to inhaled particles depends, to a great extent, on where the particle
      settles, for example: irritant dust that settles in the nose may lead to
      rhinitis, an inflammation of the mucous membrane. If the particle attacks
      the larger air passages, inflammation of the trachea (tracheitis) or the
      bronchi (bronchitis) may be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a person breathes in, particles suspended in the air enter the nose,
      but not all of them reach the lungs. The nose is an efficient filter. Most
      large particles are stopped by the
      <span class="ast-bold">nasal hairs,</span> until they are removed
      mechanically by blowing the nose or
      <span class="ast-bold">sneezing.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the smaller particles succeed in passing through the nose to reach
      the windpipe and the dividing air tubes that lead to the lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tubes are called bronchi and bronchioles. All of these airways are
      lined by cells. The <span class="ast-bold">mucus</span> they produce
      catches most of the dust particles. Tiny hairs called cilia, covering the
      walls of the air tubes, move the mucus upward and out into the throat,
      where it is either <span class="ast-bold">coughed</span> up and
      <span class="ast-bold">spat out,</span> or
      <span class="ast-bold">swallowed.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The air reaches the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the inner part of the lungs
      with any dust particles smaller than 5–7 μm. The alveoli are very
      important because through them, the body receives oxygen and releases
      carbon dioxide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dust that reaches the lower part of the airways and the alveoli (where
      there are no cilia) is attacked by special cells called
      <span class="ast-bold">macrophages.</span> These are extremely important
      for the defence of the lungs. They keep the air sacs clean. Macrophages
      virtually swallow the particles in a process known as
      <span class="ast-bold">phagocytosis</span> (see notes on the innate immune
      system later). Then the macrophages, in a way which is not well
      understood, reach the part of the airways that is covered by cilia. The
      wavelike motions of the cilia move the macrophages which contain dust to
      the throat, where they are spat out or swallowed.
    </p>

      alt=""
      class="ast-img"
    />

    <p>
      If the amount of dust is large, the macrophage system may fail. Dust
      particles and dust- containing macrophages collect in the lung tissues,
      causing injury to the lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amount of dust and the kinds of particles involved influence how
      serious the lung injury will be, for example: after the macrophages
      swallow silica particles, they die and give off toxic substances. These
      substances cause fibrous or scar tissue to form. This tissue is the body’s
      normal way of repairing itself. The general name for this condition for
      fibrous tissue formation and scarring is
      <span class="ast-bold">fibrosis,</span> for example: crystalline silica,
      causes a condition called silicosis, and coal causes pneumoconiosis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides macrophages, the lungs have another system for the removal of
      dust. The lungs can react to the presence of germ-bearing particles by
      producing certain proteins. These proteins attach to particles to
      neutralise them (see notes on the adaptive immune system later).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some small particles, less than 5 μm, may dissolve in the bloodstream. The
      blood then carries the substance around the body where it may affect the
      brain, kidneys and other organs.
    </p>
    <p>Smaller particles, less than 5 μm may also be breathed out.</p>
    <p>Several factors influence the effects of inhaled particles:</p>

      Chemicals entering the digestive system will have to survive acid and

    <p>
      The body tries to remove certain toxic substances from the digestive
      system by causing vomiting and diarrhoea. These are immediate responses
      and their aim is to remove the toxic chemicals as quickly as possible.
      However, these response mechanisms cannot remove

    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of the chemicals will be dealt with by the kidneys and
