      Fatigue refers to the issues that arise from excessive working time or
      poorly designed shift patterns. It is generally considered to be a decline
      in mental and / or physical performance that results from prolonged
      exertion, sleep loss and / or disruption of the internal clock. It is also
      related to workload, in that workers are more easily fatigued if their
      work is machine-paced, complex or monotonous.
    </p>
    <p>The ORR (2012) defined fatigue as:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        “a state of perceived weariness that can result from prolonged working,
        heavy workload, insufficient rest and inadequate sleep”.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      Fatigue results in slower reactions, reduced ability to process
      information, memory lapses, absent-mindedness, decreased awareness, lack
      of attention, underestimation of risk, reduced coordination etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fatigue can lead to errors and accidents, ill-health and injury, and
      reduced productivity. It is often a root cause of major accidents eg
      Herald of Free Enterprise, Chernobyl, Texas City, Clapham Junction,
      Challenger and Exxon Valdez.

      <p>Fatigue risk management</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Assessing and managing the risks from shift work and fatigue can be
      complex. As outlined in HSE’s good practice guidance on managing shift
      work, a planned and systematic approach to assessing and managing the
      risks of shift work and fatigue is important.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organisations whose staff are likely to work long hours from time to time,
      who work significant overtime or who do shift work are likely to have
      greater potential fatigue risks. If staff are engaged in potentially
      dangerous activities where makes alertness important for safety a fatigue
      risk management system (FRMS) is recommended to formalised controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      An FRMS can be thought of as a management control loop with the following
      four successive, repeating steps as shown in the image and outlined in the
      table below.
