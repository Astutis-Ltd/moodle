    <p>
      As mentioned, effective management of the health and safety concerns
      associated with shift work should be driven by the findings of a ‘suitable
      and sufficient’ risk assessment with input from the workforce to ensure
      the identification of hazards and consideration of groups and individual
      workers that may be more vulnerable to harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the shift work risk factors are understood sensible, proportionate
      improvements must be made to control the risks ‘so far as is reasonably
      practicable’.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many different shift-work schedules and each schedule has
      different features. The sheer diversity of work and workplaces mean that
      there is no single best practice shift management system that provides a
      universal solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following factors (see table below) should be considered when
      determining suitable arrangements.
    </p>

                Consideration should be given to the mental and physical demands
                of the work and the impact on fatigue, concentration and
                productivity.
              </p>
              The workload should be appropriate for the length and timing of

              If possible, a variety of tasks should be scheduled into the shift
              plan. Variation through a range of tasks with different mental and
              physical demands can promote alertness and relieve physical
              fatigue.

              <p>
                Permanent regular shifts allow workers to adjust their body
                clock, but permanent night shifts are generally discouraged due
                to concerns of chronic sleep debt, fatigue, ill-health and
                impact on family life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rotating shifts limit the amount of night work as the shifts are
                shared. Constant rotation can prevent the body clock from
                adapting.
              </p>
              Forward rotating schedules and fast rotating schedules (every 2-3
              days) have been shown to be least harmful.

                Daytime shifts are preferred as they do not disrupt the internal

              </p>
              <p>
                Only a small number of workers can successfully adapt to night
                work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Early morning starts (before 0700) are not as harmful as night
                shifts but can also reduce sleep and increase the risk of
                fatigue and ill-health.
              </p>
              Afternoon shifts are suitable for most workers with minimal
              negative impact on the body clock. Can significantly impact on
              family and social life.

                12-hour shifts are popular as they make the working week

              Shifts longer than 8 hours should generally be avoided where work
              is demanding, safety critical or monotonous, and / or there is
