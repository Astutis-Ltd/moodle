    <p>
      The Working Time Regulations 1998 (as amended) provide the following basic
      rights and protections for workers:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          a limit of an average of 48 hours a week which a worker can be
          required to n work (though workers can choose to work more if they
          want to)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          for night workers, a limit of an average of 8 hours work in each
          24-hour period
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          a right for night workers to receive free health assessments
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          a right to 11 hours consecutive rest a day
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">a right to a day off each week</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          a right to a rest break if the working day is longer than six hours
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          a right to four weeks’ paid leave per year.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      To ensure that workers are fit for night work, employers must offer a free
      health assessment to anyone who is about to start working nights and to
      all night workers on a regular basis.
    </p>
    <p>A night worker cannot opt-out of the night work limit.</p>
    <p>
      Where a night worker’s work involves special hazards or heavy physical or
      mental strain, there is an absolute limit of eight hours on the worker’s
      working time each day – this is not an average.
