    <p>
      The Fatigue and Risk Index (FRI) was designed primarily for comparing
      different shift schedules but can also be used to identify any particular
      shift, within a given schedule, which may be of concern. It contains two
      separate indices, one related to fatigue (the Fatigue Index) and the other
      to risk (the Risk Index).
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the FRI is a useful tool, which can be used to help assess the
      risks of fatigue and injury, it should not be relied upon as the sole or
      primary means of assessing these risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRI outputs should also be considered in conjunction with the guidelines
      in HSG256 feedback from staff on how tiring they find their work patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      When interpreting fatigue index scores it is important that the scores for
      each shift are considered rather than the average scores over a schedule.

          Fatigue index scores from 0 to 100 represent the average probability
          expressed as a percentage of high levels of sleepiness. A score of 50
          on the Fatigue Index represents a 50% chance of:

    <p>
      HSE does not currently specify threshold scores for fatigue. Recent
      research by the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL) found that the great
      majority of working patterns surveyed produced fatigue scores less than 30
      - 35 for day shifts and 40 - 45 for night shifts. These figures were what
      was achievable in the rail sector at the time.

    <p>
      A risk index score of 1 is based on the average level of risk of accident
      / error attained in studies on people working 12 hour shifts on a 2 day, 2
      night, 4 rest day schedule in the rail sector. Consequently, a risk score
      of 2, could be interpreted as a doubling of risk on that particular shift
      schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
      NB both indices are based on group data and do not take into account
      individual differences such as age, specific work-related issues e.g.
      exposure to chemical hazards, or social factors such as lifestyle and
      domestic responsibilities.
