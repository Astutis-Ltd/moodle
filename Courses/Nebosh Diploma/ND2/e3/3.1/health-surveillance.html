      Health surveillance is the ongoing assessment and / or medical examination
      of an employee at regular intervals to determine the employees’ health
      state in the context of exposure to occupational health hazards.
    </p>
    <p>The objectives of health surveillance are to:</p>

          Protect the health of individual employees by detecting as early as

    <p>
      Systematic, regular and appropriate procedures must be implemented to
      detect early signs of work-related ill health among employees exposed to
      certain health risks, and appropriate action taken to prevent any
      progression of work-related ill health.
    </p>
    <p>
      To comply with the law, this means selecting from a range of specific

          clear reaction where someone is working with something that could harm
          their health. For example: a manager checking for skin damage on hands

          <span class="ast-bold"> A ‘qualified’ person asking </span> employees
          about symptoms of ill-health, or inspecting or examining individuals
          for signs of ill-health. For example: an audiometrician conducting a
          hearing test, or an occupational health nurse carrying out a lung
          function test where workers regularly use certain paints

          <span class="ast-bold"> Medical surveillance </span> by a doctor,
