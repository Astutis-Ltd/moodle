      This element explores the related concepts of health surveillance, medical
      surveillance and biological monitoring. Working definitions for key terms
      follow.

      <span class="ast-bold"> Health surveillance </span> is a system of ongoing
      health checks. These health checks may be required by law for employees
      who are exposed to noise or vibration, ionising radiation, solvents,
      fumes, dusts, biological agents and other substances hazardous to health,
      or work in compressed air environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Health monitoring </span> is the term used for
      monitoring the health of workers where the effects from an activity or
      exposure at work are suspected of causing ill health effects, but the
      association has yet to be fully established. Essentially follows the same
      principles as health surveillance but is not a legal requirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Medical surveillance </span> is health
      surveillance conducted by, or under the control of an occupational health
      physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Biological monitoring </span> is the measurement
      of a chemical or its breakdown products in a biological sample (usually
      urine or blood) to indicate how much chemical has entered the body by all
      routes of exposure. For example, measurement of lead in blood of workers
      exposed to lead dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Biological effect monitoring </span> is the
      measurement of biological effects resulting from absorption of chemicals.
      For example, measurement of protein in urine of workers exposed to cadmium
      to check their kidney function.
