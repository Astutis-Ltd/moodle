    <p>
      It is implicit under the general duties of the Health and Safety at Work
      Act that the medical fitness of employees is a component of a ‘safe system
      of work’, to the extent that the effects of a medical condition are
      foreseeable. Employers therefore need take into account the individual
      employee’s fitness in respect of activities where their own health and
      safety or the health and safety of others may be affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Faculty of Occupational Medicine’s (FOM) guidance on health
      surveillance for those in safety-critical roles, defined safety critical
      roles as:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        “..those involving activities where, because of risks to the individuals
        concerned or to others, the employees need to have full, unimpaired
        control of their physical and / or mental capabilities…”
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      Those working in safety-critical roles should not be suffering from
      medical conditions, or be taking medical treatment likely to cause:

    <p>
      It should be noted that much of the monitoring can be undertaken through
      surveys and questionnaires with the workers providing a self-assessment of
      their current condition. Occupational health nurses or physicians may then
      conduct follow up assessments of groups or individuals based on the
      findings of the self-assessments.

      After initiatives to improve the workplace in accordance with the stress
      management guidelines it is necessary to monitor the impact of any
      interventions and employee surveys and interviews may well be used to
      determine whether the workers are experiencing any improvements as a
      result of the change. Line managers may notice early signs of mental
      ill-health through changed appearance, performance, behaviour etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are numerous psychological tools and test available to
      professionally evaluate workers general mental health and wellbeing, as
      well as signs of stress, anxiety and depression.

    <p>
      Given the seriousness of fall from height accidents a regular medical to
      check the workers general health, hearing, eyesight, lung-function and
      Musculo-skeletal condition is recommended. Workers should also be
      questioned regularly regarding health conditions such as vertigo and any
      medications which could cause drowsiness or affect balance etc.

    <p>Potential forklift truck operators must be:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Reasonably fit, both physically and mentally, to safely control and

          competent operators

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Reliable, with a responsible attitude to their work.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      Fitness for operating should always be judged on a case-by-case basis,
      matching the requirements of the driving task with the fitness and
      abilities of the operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      For most work with forklift trucks, a standard of fitness equivalent to
      that for the DVLA Group 1 entitlement (ordinary driving licence holders)
      would be appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DVLA guidance for medical professionals to assess medical standards of
      fitness to drive on UK roads allow for the exclusion of drivers for a
      range of medical conditions in the following categories:

    <p>
      For higher risk activities where the standards for fitness may need to be
      higher, at level 2, periodic fitness screening is recommended at
      five-yearly intervals after the age of 40 and annually after age 65.
