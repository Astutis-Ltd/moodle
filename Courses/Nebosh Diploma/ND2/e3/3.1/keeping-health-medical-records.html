      Health surveillance programmes should include keeping a health record for
      each individual. These are important because they provide:

      Health records should be completed routinely and systematically whenever
      individuals undergo health surveillance. The record can be paper-based or

    <p>
      Health records are different from clinical records in that they do not
      contain confidential clinical details and can therefore be kept securely
      with other confidential personnel records.
    </p>
    <p>
      Records which include medical information arising from clinical
      examination are held in confidence by the doctor, nurse or other
      occupational health professional and can only be released with the written
      consent of the individual. The Access to Health Records Act 1990 allows
      employees a right to see and comment on their records.

    <p>
      As a general rule, employee’s individual health records should be kept for
      as long as they are under health surveillance.
    </p>
    <p>
      CoSHH 1998, CAR 2012, and the
      <span class="ast-italic">Work in Compressed Air Regulations 1996</span>
      all require that records
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >are kept in a suitable form for at least 40 years from the date of the
        last entry made in it.</span
      >
      The guidance to CLAW 2002 also recommends keeping records for 40 years.
    </p>
    <p>IRR2017 requires that records are kept:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        …until the person to whom the record relates has or would have attained
        the age of 75 years but in any event for at least 30 years from the date
        of the last entry made in it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      CNWR 2005 and CVWR 2005 merely require that a suitable record is made and
      maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also good practice to offer individual employees a copy of their
      health records when they leave employment. Employers about to cease to
      trade are obliged under CoSHH 1998 to notify HSE and to offer to provide
      paper copies of employees’ health records for safe keeping (the same
      action is recommended in guidance to the
      <span class="ast-italic">Control of Lead at Work Regulations 2002</span>
      ).

      <p>Medical records and data protection requirements</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Medical records are compiled by a doctor or nurse and may contain
      information obtained from the individual during the course of health
      surveillance. This information may include clinical notes, biological
      results and other information related to health issues not associated with
      work. This information is confidential and should not be disclosed without
      the consent of the individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occupational health (OH) professional may obtain data as the result of
      an immunisation programme (for example, blood titres or ‘non responder’
      information). This information will be provided to the employee and should
      not be given to the employer. It will be kept in confidence by the OH
      professional and should only made known to the employer with the
      employee’s consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-italic">The Data Protection Act</span> requires those who
      hold information on health and medical records to tell those on whom
      records are held that a record is being kept, its purpose and that they
      have a right to see the information and correct it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor or nurse should only provide employers with information on
      fitness to work and any restrictions that may apply in that respect.
      Employees can have access to their own medical record through a written
      request under the Data Protection Act. These details can only be released
      to third parties, such as the employer, on receipt of the informed written
      consent of the employee, or by a court order.
