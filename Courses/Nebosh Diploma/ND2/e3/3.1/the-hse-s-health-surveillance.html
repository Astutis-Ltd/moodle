    <p>
      The HSE has proposed a ‘health surveillance cycle’ (see image below) a
      framework for determining the health surveillance needs of a particular
      workplace. The employer has a central role in every aspect with
      involvement from employees to ensure effective implementation.

    <p>
      Health surveillance may be required where a risk cannot be reduced or
      controlled to such a level that it will not be harmful to health.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following conditions should be met for health surveillance to be
      appropriate:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The work is known to damage health in some particular way
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          There are valid ways to detect the disease or condition. To be
          effective, health surveillance has to be able to reliably show that
          damage to health is starting to happen or becoming likely. The
          technique must be accurate, safe and practical
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Damage to health must be likely under the particular conditions at
          work

      The HSE’s decision making map recommends that the need for health
      surveillance is assessed as in the image below.

    <p>
      It is followed by a table which shows the range of techniques available
      and levels of competence required.
