      Biological monitoring (biological effects monitoring) may be appropriate
      under Regulation 11 of CoSHH (health surveillance) where it is possible to
      link results from biological monitoring to an adverse health effect. Under

      monitoring is appropriate where:

      <p>Control of Lead at Work Regulations 2002 (CLAW)</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      While the general philosophy of exposure control for lead is consistent
      with CoSHH, lead is subject to separate legislation - CLAW. Regulation 10
      of CLAW (medical surveillance) specifically requires biological monitoring
      and lays down biological monitoring limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular biological monitoring of the level of lead in blood or urine must
      be undertaken to detect any absorption of lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      For biological monitoring of occupational exposure to lead and its
      compounds, except lead alkyls, blood-lead concentration is the most
      commonly used indicator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blood-lead levels are usually checked every three months, especially for a
      woman capable of having children and young persons under 18. It may be
      more often if work involves a process where lead could be rapidly absorbed
      e.g. work on lead-burning processes where exposure to lead fume could be
      high unless properly controlled. The doctor may check blood-lead level
      less often if exposure and blood-lead levels do not usually change very
      much. This could be every 6 or even 12 months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employees should be told if their exposure to lead is ‘significant’ i.e.:

          Measure the level of lead in the air, and tell employees the results.
          If exposure to lead cannot be kept below the OEL, Respiratory

    <p>
      If the amount of lead in an employee’s blood reaches the action level an
      investigation will be required to ascertain why this has happened and try
      to reduce it to below that level by:

    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->
    <p>
      If, despite all the control measures the blood-lead level reaches the
      suspension level the doctor will repeat the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this confirms the result of the first test, the doctor will usually
      decide that the employee should not carry on working with lead. Action
      must be taken on the doctor’s decision, and the employee will not be able
      to work with lead again, or be exposed to it, until the doctor considers
      it safe to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are lower action levels and suspension levels for pregnant workers
      and young workers, see the table below for blood lead action and
      suspension levels.

    <p>
      If a woman is pregnant, the lead in her blood can pass into the blood of
      the baby she is carrying which could affect its development. As soon as
      pregnancy is confirmed the doctor will automatically certify that you
      should not do work where your exposure to lead is significant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The law also gives greater protection to young people under 18 because
      they generally have less experience working with a substance as hazardous
      as lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, therefore, against the law for women capable of having children,
      and for young people under 18, to work in lead smelting and refining and
      in most jobs in the manufacture of lead-acid batteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common method of biological monitoring for occupational exposure
      to lead alkyls involves measurement of total lead in urine. Total lead in
      urine reflects exposure to both inorganic lead and lead alkyls.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general urine samples will be taken every six weeks though the
      frequency may be increased to weekly if results are over 95μg Pb / g
      creatinine (20 for women of reproductive capacity) or at the doctor’s
      discretion if over 110 (25 for women of reproductive capacity).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no action levels for employees exposed to lead alkyls. The
      suspension levels for employees exposed to lead alkyls are set out in the
      table below.
