      The programme may be required because, for example, there may be a new
      process involving hazardous substances, employees have reported symptoms
      or health effects from hazardous substances, or possibly an improvement
      notice has been issued.

    <p>
      The monitoring strategy depends on what is being measured. It will need to
      consider who to monitor, how often and when to take the samples.
    </p>
    <p>
      For chemicals not assigned a BMGV, the strategy needs to be established
      with knowledge of the absorption and metabolism of the substance and any
      factors that influence them, and to consider how the substance is used in
      the workplace.

    <p>
      It is important to consult with employees before the biological monitoring
      programme starts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where an employer is required to carry out a biological monitoring by law,
      there is an obligation on employees to co-operate. In particular, employee
      participation is required under the Control of Lead at Work Regulations
      2002 (CLAW).

      Biological monitoring involves measurements on an individual’s body fluids
      (or breath) so it is important to ensure that individuals’ rights are

          Urine samples require use of the correct type of contamination-free
          container. Employees will need to change out of their work clothes and
          wash their hands before providing a sample, otherwise there is the
          possibility of inadvertent contamination of the sample.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blood sample collection involves the puncturing of a vein and so must
          be carried out by a qualified person, for example: a physician,
          suitably qualified nurse or phlebotomist. Because of the additional
          risks associated with taking blood, it is recommended that urine or
          breath (i.e. non-invasive techniques) are used for biological
          monitoring wherever possible.

      When samples cannot be sent to the laboratory immediately, it is important
      to make sure that the samples are stored properly or the biological
      monitoring results may be inaccurate and misleading.

      It is important to ensure the sample container does not break in transit,
      and does not contain any sample leakage.

    <div class="ast-heading--h4">
      <p>Analysis and quality assurance</p>
    </div>
    <!--H4 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Analytical laboratory services should operate a quality assurance scheme
      and be linked to a recognised quality standard. UKAS accreditation
      provides formal third party verification of a laboratories competence and
      ability to fulfill the requirements of the relevant international
      standards.

    <p>
      Individuals need to be informed of their results with reference to any
      BMGV (or any other criteria used for interpretation), what it means and
      what action or follow-up will take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      When there is a possibility of non-occupational exposure to a chemical,
      for example, solvents in DIY materials, it may be necessary to compare a
      sample obtained after work exposure with a pre-work level.
    </p>

        Step 8: Act on the results and evaluate the effectiveness of the

    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Where the results indicate that you are likely to need to reduce exposure
      (where a BMGV is exceeded, for example), or where accumulated data shows a
      trend towards this, it will be necessary to look at how the substance is
      being handled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Follow-up monitoring or increasing the frequency of monitoring will need
      to be considered. This will ensure that any changes made to control
      measures have been effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where specific guidance is available for a chemical this may contain
      further information on what action is necessary.
