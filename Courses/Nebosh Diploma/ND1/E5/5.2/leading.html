    <p>Consider the following examples:</p>
    <p>
      When driving on a long journey,
      <span class="ast-bold"> running out of fuel</span> could be an event of
      concern. The fuel gauge and low fuel warning provide leading indicators
      and will give early warnings that the vehicle is going to run out of fuel
      which will allow preventive action to be taken. Should the vehicle stop
      suddenly because it has run out of fuel that provides a lagging indicator.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold"> Blood pressure level</span> provides a leading
      indicator of an individual’s risk of experiencing a heart attack, stroke
      or liver failure and again provides an early warning and an opportunity
      for lifestyle changes or early medical intervention. Data that can be
      gathered on numbers or rates of heart attacks etc that may be associated
      with high blood pressure provide lagging indicators.

      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold"> Leading indicators</span> can be actively
          monitored, focussing on the ongoing effectiveness of controls. They
          can be considered as measures of process or inputs essential to
          deliver the desired safety outcome
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold"> Lagging indicators</span> can be reactively
          monitored and provide measures of failure showing when a desired
          safety outcome has failed or has not been achieved.

    <p>
      There are clear benefits in having combinations of leading and lagging
      indicators to provide a complete picture of performance in a particular
      area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for reviewing overall health and safety
      performance could include:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Multilevel Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Lagging indicators of accident, ill-health and incident rates
          (accompanied by analysis of both the immediate and underlying causes,
          trends and common features)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Leading indicators such as:
          <div class="ast-list-second">
            <ul class="ast-list__bullet-second">
              <li class="ast-list__bullet__item-second">
                the degree of compliance with health and safety system
                requirements
              </li>
              <li class="ast-list__bullet__item-second">
                performance against specific objectives and plans
              </li>
              <li class="ast-list__bullet__item-second">
                level of unsafe behaviours and unsafe conditions in the
                workplace.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      These indicators are consistent with the development of a positive health
      and safety culture. They emphasise achievement and success rather than
      merely measuring failure by looking only at accident data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The obvious problem with lagging indicators is that the learning
      opportunity comes after a failure and associated losses. The challenge
      with leading indicators is finding the right things to measure. To be
      effective a leading indicator has to be causally linked to, and therefore
      an effective predictor of, the event and outcome of concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, the amount of safety training undertaken isn’t necessarily
      a good leading indicator of safety performance, whereas a reduction in
      unsafe acts and conditions (which might be achieved as a result of a
      training intervention) could be (basic domino theory).
