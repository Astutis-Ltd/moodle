    <p>
      The traditional approaches to measuring health and safety performance
      focussed on the measurement of negative outcomes or failures, i.e. injury
      and ill-health statistics. This is very different to measurement of other
      aspects of an organisations performance which focus on measures of success
      such as profits, return on investment and market share.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health and safety differs from many areas measured by managers because
      success results in the absence of an outcome (injuries or ill-health)
      rather than a presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low injury or ill-health rate, even over a period of years, is no
      guarantee that risks are being controlled and does not indicate low
      injuries or ill-health going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historical records can be particularly deceptive indicators of safety
      performance in organisations where major hazards are present, but there is
      a low probability of accidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no single reliable measure of health and safety performance. What
      is required is a ‘basket’ of measures or a ‘balanced scorecard’, providing
      information on a range of health and safety activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Problems with an over reliance on injury/ill-health statistics as an
      indicator of health and safety performance include:

          a low injury rate might be attributable to luck or fewer people

    <p>
      Recognition of the drawbacks associated with the use of reactive injury
      and ill-health data has led to a search for more proactive or ‘up stream’
      measures of performance. Often though, this has resulted in the
      measurement of things which can be easily counted, such as numbers of
      training courses or numbers of inspections.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is necessary is a systematic approach to derive meaningful proactive
      measures that indicate the effectiveness, or otherwise of the risk control
      systems.

    <p>
      This provides a firm basis for decisions about improvements in risk
      control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Active monitoring systems should be proportional to the hazard profile.
      Activity should concentrate on areas where it is likely to produce the
      greatest benefit and lead to the greatest control of risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key risk control systems and related workplace precautions should
      therefore be monitored in more detail or more often (or both) than
      low-risk systems or management arrangements.

      Each event provides an opportunity for an organisation to check
      performance, learn from mistakes, and improve the health and safety
      management system and risk controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collecting information on serious injuries and ill-health should not
      present major problems for most organisations, but learning about minor
      injuries, other losses, incidents and hazards can prove more challenging.
      There is value in collecting information on all actual and potential
      losses to learn how to prevent more serious events.

    <p>
      Objectivity and subjectivity occur along a spectrum from the highly
      objective to the highly subjective. In a swimming race, competitors are
      accurately timed – a highly objective measure, whereas in a diving
      competition the divers are graded in a highly subjective way by judges
      interpreting competition rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health and safety performance measurement is undertaken to provide
      management information to show how well, or not, an organisation is
      managing the risks arising from its undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Management information is essential to enable an organisations senior
      management to understand the organisations performance, solve problems,
      analyse trends and forecast the future.
