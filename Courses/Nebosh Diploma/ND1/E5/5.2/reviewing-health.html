    <p>
      Reviewing is the process of making judgements about the adequacy of
      performance and taking decisions about the nature and timing of the
      actions necessary to remedy deficiencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reviewing should be a continuous process undertaken at different levels
      within the organisation. It includes responses by first-line supervisors
      and other line managers to remedy failures to implement workplace
      precautions which they observe in the course of routine activities, and to
      remedy sub-standard performance identified by active and reactive
      monitoring in their areas of responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Management reviews should be carried out by top management, on a regular
      basis (quarterly, semi-annually, or annually) and can be carried out by
      meetings or other communication means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reviews of the performance of parts of the health and safety management
      system can be held at more frequent intervals, if appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Top management reviews should focus on the overall performance of the
      health and safety management system with regard to its:

      In planning for a management review, consideration should be given to the
      topics to be reviewed, the appropriate participants and their
      responsibilities within the review, and specific evidence to be considered
      at the review.

      HSG65 considers that the main sources of information will be the results
      of monitoring activities and audits of the management system. ISO 45001
      (and ISO 45002, guidelines for its implementation) recommends
      consideration of the following inputs:

      Any of the input information could necessitate a redesign or modification
      to any part of the Health and Safety Management System (HSMS) or a change
      in direction or objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      As discussed in the earlier section on proactive safety management (Safety
      II) it is also important to take the opportunity to learn from what is
      going well in the organisation, as well as the failures.

    <p>
      The outputs should be communicated to workers or their representatives and
      a suitable record should be kept of the review process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Progress against the review output remedial actions should be closely
      monitored. The relative priority of individual responses should be
      determined by the degree of risk involved and the availability of
      resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on the decisions and actions agreed at a review, the nature and
      types of communication of the results of the review, and to whom they will
      be communicated, should also be considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeding information on success and failure back into the system is an
      essential element in motivating employees to maintain and improve
      performance. Successful organisations emphasise positive reinforcement and
      concentrate on encouraging progress on those indicators which demonstrate
      improvements in risk control.
