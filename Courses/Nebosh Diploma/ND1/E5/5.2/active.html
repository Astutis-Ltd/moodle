      <p>Health and safety audits</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Organisations are often subject to audit, e.g. for finance, environment
      and quality. The process should also be applied to health and safety.
    </p>
    <p>The HSE define an audit as:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        ...the structured process of collecting independent information on the
        efficiency, effectiveness and reliability of the total health and safety
        management system and drawing up plans for corrective action.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      Auditing supports monitoring by providing managers with information on how
      effectively plans and the components of the health and safety management
      system are being implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auditing is an essential element of a health and safety management system,
      but is no substitute for day to day control. Health and safety, like
      finance, cannot be managed by audits alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aims of auditing a health and safety management system should be to
      establish that:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          appropriate management arrangements are in place
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          adequate risk control systems exist, are implemented, and are
          consistent with the hazard profile of the organisation
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          appropriate workplace precautions are in place.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Various methods can achieve this and some components of the system do not
      need to be audited as often as others. For instance, an audit of the
      management arrangements and the overall capability of an organisation to
      manage health and safety need not be done as often as an audit to verify
      the implementation of risk control systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Critical risk control systems, which control major hazards, will require
      most frequent attention and may require specialist technical input.
    </p>
    <p>
      A team approach, involving managers, safety representatives and employees
      is an effective way to widen involvement and co-operation in devising and
      implementing the programme.

      Collecting information about health and safety management requires

      and a key question is always: ‘How much sampling needs to be done to make

    <p>
      The adequacy of a health and safety management system is judged by making
      a comparison between what is found against a relevant standard or
      benchmark. If there are no clear standards, the assessment process will be
      unreliable.

    <p>
      Legal standards, HSE guidance and applicable industry standards should be
      used to inform audit judgements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auditing should not be perceived as a fault-finding activity but as an
      integral part of the health and safety management system. Auditing should
      recognise positive achievements as well as areas for improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scoring systems may be used to help with comparing audit scores over time
      or between sites, but there is no evidence to suggest that quantifying the
      results is better than a qualitative approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scoring systems can introduce difficulties, for example: managers focus on

      Timing of inspections needs to be considered in the light of work
      patterns. There are pros and cons in terms of what will be seen in an
      inspection at quieter or busier times which needs to be balanced against
      the broader business needs for meeting production targets, delivery
      schedules etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Systems for inspecting, examining and testing a range of work equipment
      are required by legislation, e.g. pressure vessels, lifts, cranes, chains,
      ropes, lifting tackle, power presses, scaffolds, trench supports and Local
      Exhaust Ventilation (LEV).

      Schedules and performance standards can be helpful in defining the
      frequency and content of inspections.

      <p>Safety sampling</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Safety sampling uses random sampling to assess the accident potential in a
      specific work area or process by identifying safety defects or omissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work area is divided into sections and a trained observer is appointed
      to each section. The observer takes approx. 15 minutes to follow a planned
      route through the area making notes of safety defects as they go.
    </p>
    <p>
      A limited number of issues are usually specified for the exercise such as,
      housekeeping, wearing of PPE, manual handling technique and machinery
      guarding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results of the sampling activity are collated, analysed and presented
      to the safety committee and/or management team as part of the procedures
      for monitoring and review.

    <p>
      A survey is a detailed examination of a number of critical areas of
      operation or an in-depth study of the whole health and safety operation of
      premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The survey design will depend on a range of variables such as, the
      organisations hazard profile and levels of risk, the number of employees,
      the location of the premises in relation to urban population, the
      potential for pollution incidents and the range of products manufactured.

      A safety tour is an unscheduled examination of a work area typically

      specific health and safety standards (e.g. housekeeping / PPE Use / fire
      precautions).
    </p>
    <p>
      To be effective, it is imperative that items of concern identified during
      the tour are seen to be addressed promptly.

      <p>Behavioural observations</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Traditional behaviour-based safety programmes involve an observer watching
      a person conducting a task and looking for safe and unsafe ways of working
      against a list of task-based behaviours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observers are trained on how to conduct the observation and how to provide
      positive and constructive feedback to the person they are observing.

      <p>Safety conversations</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Rather than just encouraging conversation between workers when risky
      behaviours are observed safety conversations are intended to encourage
      ongoing, quality, open communications about safety between all employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objective is to create an environment where workers are comfortable
      and confident to speak up about safety concerns and to suggest safety
      improvements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice the motivation for and success of safety conversation
      initiatives will depend upon the maturity of the safety culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the poorer end of the spectrum the motivation can be about control,
      criticising poor behaviours and seeking compliance through corrective
      action. At the more positive end of the spectrum the motivation is about
      caring for the workforce, seeking to engage them and encouraging greater
      participation through collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safety conversations may be initiated by managers, supervisors or peers.
      It is important that they are trained in how to initiate and conduct a
      conversation, to remove barriers to communication and to encourage worker
      engagement and collaboration.

      A benchmark was, originally, a reference point used in surveying, the term
      has come to mean a standard for comparison against.

      Benchmarking should involve more than just a comparison of numerical
