        The benefits of measuring what goes right<br />(proactive safety
        management)<br />
      </h2>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      As discussed in element 2 traditional (Safety I) approaches to safety
      management have been criticised for focussing on things that go wrong,
      rather than on things that go right. ‘Safety II’ proposes a shift of
      emphasis, focussing on the things that go right, looking for measures of
      the presence of safety, rather than the absence of danger. It is important
      to note that Hollnagel has always advocated adding ‘Safety II’ thinking to
      traditional approaches to safety rather than replacing the old with the
      new.
    </p>
    <p>
      With ‘Safety II’ it is important to look at what goes right as well as
      what goes wrong and to learn from successes as well as failures. Note the
      commonality of approach with resilience engineering and high reliability
      organisations as discussed in element 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas ‘Safety I’ assumes that things go well because workers follow the
      rules and work as imagined, ‘Safety II’ assumes that things go well
      because workers can adapt and make sensible adjustments to cope with
      current and future situational demands. Therefore, ‘work as done’ may be
      significantly different from ‘work as imagined’. The variability that gets
      the job done safely on one day is the same variability that causes an
      accident on the next. Safety II proposes that rather than attempting to
      create safety management procedures which everyone must comply efforts are
      put into building resilient systems that can flex to accommodate
      unpredictable variables.

    </p>
    <p>
      Safety 1 tends to focus on in depth analysis of things that go wrong at
      the extreme left of the curve. Safety II advocates looking at the breadth
      of information available under the central parts of the curve to
      understand what people are doing on a day-to-day basis to keep things
      going right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Measuring what goes right involves understanding ‘work as done’, observing
      work and interviewing workers to understand the challenges workers face
      and the types of ‘performance adjustments’ they make to adapt to
      day-to-day variations. In addition to field observations and interviews
      there are a number of approaches used in social sciences and action
      research that could be useful here, such as cooperative or collaborative
      inquiry, appreciative inquiry and exnovation as defined in table 5.5

              A way in which people who have similar concerns and interests
              intentionally develop together their own experience and action to
              make sense of their lives and acquire new ways of looking at
              things and, above all, to know how to act to change the things
              they may want to change and how to do things better.

              The inquiry follows a research cycle through the four different
              types of knowledge: propositional, practical, experiential and
              presentational.

      Workers typically make performance adjustments for one of three reasons:

      All three adjustments are used constantly at work, either individually or
      in combinations.

      Looking for opportunities to learn how to improve in this way can result
      in ergonomic improvements to system design and worker development through
      training etc helping to deliver more reliable and resilient work
      processes.
