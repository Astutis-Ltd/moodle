        >The impact that statistics can have on an organisation and
        organisational reputation</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Effectively managing reputational risk requires recognition that
      reputation is a matter of perception of the various stakeholders of the
      organisation’s performance across a range of variables such as quality,
      governance, social responsibility, financial performance etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can therefore be seen that an organisations reputation is distinct from
      its performance and may be better or worse. Understanding this potential
      disparity and managing the closure of any reputation-reality gaps is
      essential to maintain the organisations reputation.

          is what we think of it. The tree is the real thing.”</em

    <p>
      When the organisation’s reputation is better than the underlying reality a
      substantial risk exists in that if a poor underlying reality is revealed
      the reputation will crash rapidly to match the reality. As an example,
      consider the positioning of BP as an environmentally responsible
      organisation in the early 2000’s as impacted by the Texas City refinery
      explosion in 2005 and the Prudhoe Bay, Alaska oil pipeline leak in 2006.
      The resulting media interest led to a 50% drop in share value with BP
      dropping from the second largest global oil company, by value, to the
      fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The availability of performance data statistics across a balanced
      scorecard of variables will be helpful in recognising and addressing any
      gaps between an organisation’s reputation and reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good data across a range of trust factors such as integrity, social
      responsibility etc demonstrably impacts positively on staff recruitment
      and retention, customer engagement and shareholder investment.

      <strong>Methods of calculating loss rates</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The continuous measurement of accident and incident numbers over time
      allows trends to be plotted illustrating any fluctuations in performance
      levels over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      However such fluctuations in performance can be influenced by a range of
      business variables other than the direct impact of health and safety
      management. For example: increases in levels of production, changes in
      staff levels or working patterns, or an increase in staff turnover.
    </p>
    <p>
      To combat these additional variables accident rates are used. A rate does
      not consider the accident numbers in isolation but in the context of a
      specific denominator such as number of employees or number of hours
      worked. Providing that consistent definitions are used, rates also allow
      useful comparisons to be made of performance in different businesses etc.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Accident Incidence Rate (AIR)</strong></p>
    <p>
      This is probably the most widely used formula, and is the number of
      defined accidents, (e.g. RIDDOR reportable accident incidence rate) in a
      period per thousand employees.
    </p>

    <p>
      The HSE publishes accident incidence rates in its annual report (available
      from the HSE statistics webpages), where incidence is calculated as a rate
      of reportable injuries per 100 000 employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      When comparing and benchmarking incidence rates across departments or
      sites, care should be taken to ensure a comparison of like with like, for
      example:

      The AFR is the number of defined accidents in a period per 100 000 person

      working.

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Accident Severity Rate (ASR)</strong></p>
    <p>
      The ASR is the number of working days lost in a period per 1 000 person
      hours worked. It indicates the severity of the accidents in terms of time
      lost due to injury in addition to the number of accidents. The results can
      be skewed by low morale (people taking off longer than their injury
      warrants), sick pay policies (people continuing to work in spite of
      injuries because they need their pay) and ‘light duties’ work (minimises
      days lost).

      If the data has been collected at a single point in time it is referred to
      as a point prevalence rate. It is often more convenient to collect data
      over a specified period of time, in which case it is a period prevalence
      rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In interpreting a prevalence rate the following factors should be
      considered:
