      Accidents typically arise as a consequence of a combination of causes so
      rather than a linear row of dominoes it is better represented as a tree
      with multiple rows of dominoes coming together to cause the accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are numerous tools and techniques available for structuring the
      lines of inquiry in an investigation. Their suitability will depend on the
      complexity of the accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a simple example, the investigation works down from a top event which
      describes the accident and injury working through different rows of
      immediate, underlying and root causes.

      In his 1971 book
      <em><strong>‘Techniques of Safety Management’ </strong></em>Dan Peterson
      proposed an accident model that was an amalgamation of both the domino and
      multi-causality theories as shown above. Peterson suggested that there are
      many contributing factors, causes and sub-causes behind every accident,
      combining together, in random fashion, to cause accidents. Therefore there
      is a need to identify as many of these causes as possible during an
      investigation, rather than just one for each stage of the domino sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in his career Peterson developed a <em>‘human factors’</em> model of
      accident causation to address his observation that accidents are caused by
      people and not ‘things’.
