    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>
      It is difficult, if not impossible, to gain information from every member
      of a defined population. Typically, sample data is obtained from a
      (hopefully) representative sample of the population and inferences are
      made regarding the population as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The larger the sample the more likely it is to be representative of the
      whole. If several large samples were randomly taken from the same
      population you might expect slight variations, however they would be
      expected to be similar to each other and to the population as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statistical models are used to assess how closely the sample data
      represents the population at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mean is the simplest statistical model. Adding a range of values
      together and dividing by the number of values gives the arithmetical mean.
      This is a hypothetical value in that it need not match any of the actual
      values and may well be a fraction where this would be impossible (e.g. 2.4
      children).
    </p>
    <p>
      How representative a model is can be determined by comparing the
      differences (deviances) between actual observed measures and the model
      (the mean).
    </p>
    <p>
      <img

        width="100%"
      /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The total error in the model could be calculated by adding up all the
      deviances however this would balance out at zero, with the positive and
      negative deviances balancing each other out.
    </p>
    <p>
      To address this, the sum of squared errors is calculated to give an
      overall positive number. This then poses a different problem in that the
      number gets ever larger with the population size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dividing the sum of squared errors by n – 1 (the number of observations
      minus one) calculates the variance which is the average error between the
      mean and the observations made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem with the variance as a measure is that it is in units squared.
      By taking the square root of the variance the measure of average error is
      being made in the same units as the original measure. This is known as the
      standard deviation (SD or σ ‑ sigma).
    </p>
    <p>
      The standard deviation is a useful measure of the fit of the model, i.e.
      how well the mean fits the data. A small standard deviation indicates that
      observed data points are close to the mean. A large standard deviation
      means that the observed data points are distant from the mean (i.e. that
      the mean is not an accurate representation of the data).
    </p>
    <p>
      With a normally distributed population the standard deviation is also
      useful in understanding proportions under the curve. The point of
      inflection (see below) is the point at which the curve changes from convex
      to concave and begins to tail off. The distance from the mean to the point
      of inflection is equal to one SD. The range of mean plus or minus one
      standard deviation (M ± 1SD or 2SD or 2σ) encompasses approximately 68% of
      the sample population. 95% of the population is in the range M ± 2SD (or
      4SD or 4σ). 99.7% of the population is within M ± 3SD (or 6SD or 6σ).

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Statistical variability</strong></p>
    <p>
      A variable is something that changes (or varies). The variation may be
      between individuals (example: height, IQ, eye colour), by geographical
      location (example: site A or site B), or over time (example: by quarter or
      by year).
    </p>
    <p>Variables may be:</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Categorical</strong> – one that names distinct entities.
      Categorical variables may be:

    <p>
      Variables should be measurable consistently over time and across
      locations. For directly measurable variables, suitably calibrated
      equipment (examples: sound level meter, weighing scales or thermometer)
      help to ensure the consistency of measurement. In other cases variables
      are measured indirectly using tools such as self-assessment
      questionnaires.

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Chance and bias</strong></p>
    <p>
      The results of a test sample may vary from the population at large due to
      chance or random fluctuation. This is most likely with a small sample
      which is less likely to be representative of the parent population than a
      large sample. For example, if a coin is tossed three times and comes up
      heads each time this is a matter of chance and is not representative of
      the expected result in a larger population. If a coin is tossed one
      thousand times, the heads: tails ratio should be close to 50:50.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bias </strong>is a systematic (or non-random) variation between a
      sample population and the parent population. The major biases are:
