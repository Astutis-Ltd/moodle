    <p>
      Reason observed that organisational accidents (unlike individual
      accidents) typically have multiple causes involving many people operating
      at different management levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reason’s basic theory is that for an organisational accident to occur, the
      protective barriers and safeguards (defences) designed to prevent losses
      must be breached.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reason considered that an organisations processes could be divided into
      production processes and protection processes.

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">Production</span> processes such as the
          manufacture of goods, extraction of raw materials, delivery of service
          etc. expose people and assets to danger
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">Protection</span> processes, which are designed
          to protect people and assets from the danger arising from production
          processes.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      Reason coined the term ‘defences in depth’ to explain the concept of
      successive layers of protection guarding against the possible failure of
      the one in front.
    </p>
    <p>‘Defences in depth’ could look like this:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          alarms and warning of imminent danger
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          positioning barriers between hazards and potential losses
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          eliminating or controlling hazards that escape the barrier
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          providing means of escape and rescue should hazard containment fail.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      In an ideal world the layers of defences in depth prevent the hazard from
      adversely affecting people and assets but in the real world each layer of
      defence will have gaps or weaknesses. Reason explained these gaps in his
      ‘Swiss cheese’ model.
    </p>

      alt=""
      class="ast-img"
    />

    <p>
      The Swiss cheese model should be thought of as a moving picture with each
      defence coming into and out of play depending on local conditions. The
      ‘holes’ in each defence also move, shrink or grow in response to operator
      actions and local needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ‘holes’ may be created by active failures and/or latent conditions.
    </p>

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">Active failures</span> are unsafe acts that
          have a direct and immediate effect on system safety. Typically they
          are errors and violations at the sharp end of the system
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">Latent conditions</span> include: poor design,
          gaps in supervision, undetected manufacturing defects, training gaps
          and maintenance failures. Latent conditions may be present for many
          years before they combine with active failures and local circumstances
          to penetrate layers of defences. Latent conditions typically arise
          from strategic, top level decisions.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      For an organisational accident to occur a rare conjunction of a set of
      holes in successive defences would be necessary for the hazard to reach
      and damage people or other assets.
    </p>

      class="ast-img"
    />

    <p>
      Reason considered that protection processes fail because of a combination
      of human, technical and organisational factors: organisational factors
      lead to the creation of error-provoking local working conditions resulting
      in an individual (or team) unsafe act. If the defences subsequently fail
      the outcome is a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The below figure shows Reason’s model to explain the sequence of accident
      causation and the corresponding, reversed, sequence of accident
      investigation. In an accident investigation the sequence works back from
      the loss, firstly considering how the defences failed and what active
      failures and latent conditions were involved. Subsequently for each unsafe
      act the investigation seeks to determine what local conditions shaped or
      provoked it, and ultimately what upstream organisational factors
      contributed to the development of each local condition.
