      As discussed earlier the coming together of the individual and the job
      creates a risk interface where it is possible for hazards to injure the
      individual or for individual error to adversely affect the task or
      equipment and create further hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ergonomics is all about ensuring the physical and psychological fit
      between the individual and the task and equipment. Understanding the ways
      that humans fail and the variables that influence the likelihood of
      failure facilitate the effective design of tasks and equipment to fit the
      individual and reduce the likelihood of failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The variables which make it more or less likely that human(s) will fail
      are termed Performance Influencing Factors (PIFs). Optimising the
      characteristics of the job, the individual and the organisation that
      influence human performance will reduce the likelihood of all types of
      human failure.
    </p>
    <p>The personal performance influencing factors (PIFs) are:</p>

      Regulation 6 of the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations
      requires every employer to provide his employees with appropriate health
      surveillance having regard to the risks to their health and safety which
      are identified by the assessment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health surveillance is about putting in place systematic, regular and
      appropriate procedures to detect early signs of work-related ill health
      among employees exposed to certain health risks and acting on the results
      to prevent any progression of work- related ill health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health surveillance begins with a baseline assessment of health when an
      employee takes up a new job followed by the use of appropriate techniques
      (from self-checks to medical surveillance and biological monitoring) to
      detect harmful health effects at an early stage so that workers can be
      protected and kept fir for work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baseline health assessments can help ensure that an individual is
      generally in good physical and mental health and has the required
      abilities to undertake a given role.

      The HSE’s fatigue index can be used to evaluate the effects of rotating
      shift patterns. The index looks at the following five key factors
      associated with the development of fatigue to provide an overall index for
      the pattern of work:

      The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) can be used to determine the likelihood
      of dozing in a range of everyday situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the Working Time Regulations employers are required to ensure that
      workers are fit for night work and must offer a free health assessment to
      anyone who is about to start working nights and to all night workers on a
      regular basis. The HSE advises that if a worker suffers from health
      problems that are caused or made worse by night work he / she should,
      wherever possible be transferred to day work.

      Health surveillance arrangements can be implemented to detect early signs

      Training is a planned and systematic effort to modify or develop
      knowledge, skills and attitude through learning experiences to achieve
      effective performance in an activity or range of activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      As shown earlier, training is one of many interrelated influences on an
      individual’s behaviour. It can be seen that the individual cannot be
      considered in isolation – the influence of the job as designed, and the
      organisational culture also impact upon behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safety training may look to influence an individual’s attitude by
      improving knowledge of the hazards and the consequences of risky
      behaviour. However the behaviour will only change if the person desires
      that change, and if the work climate is supportive of the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Training design can be approached in accordance with the five stage
      process, often referred to as ADDIE (Analyse, Design / develop, Deliver,
      Implement, Evaluate):

      Has the desired behaviour change been affected? Has the level of skilled

      The Advisory Committee on Safety in the Nuclear Industry (ACSNI) published
      a report in 1990 considering the contribution made by training to safety.
      They concluded that for training in safety critical activities:

          regularly reviewed and updated in keeping with technical and
          organisational developments. Safety should be an aspect of all

          Training therefore should not focus purely on knowledge transfer and
