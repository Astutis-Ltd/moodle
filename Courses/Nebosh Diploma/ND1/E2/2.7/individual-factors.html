    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      High internal temperatures (38.5°C) have been shown to increase the speed
      of performance due to an acceleration of the body’s internal clock. Risk
      taking behaviours and error rates also increase with high internal
      temperatures. The relationship is dose responsive – diminution of
      performance increases the longer workers internal temperature remains
      high.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relative humidity also has an impact. 35 to 40% is the optimal range,
      while levels over 75% have been shown to lead to diminished performance.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Cold causes peripheral vasoconstriction, shivering, impaired neural
      conduction and poor muscular control, all of which may affect reaction
      times. Research has shown that work at lower temperatures (6°C) was slower
      and more cautious than work at 18-24°C.

    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Vibration can affect task performance by causing body parts to resonate,
      degrading vision and manual control. At 5 hertz (Hz) the shoulder girdle
      resonates, between 20 and 30 Hz the head resonates between the shoulders
      and at higher frequencies the eyes may also resonate.

      <p>Light</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Poor workplace lighting can cause discomfort or disabling glare, visual
      fatigue and eye strain. A lack of natural lighting usually leads to
      increased levels of dissatisfaction with the working environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunlight also has biochemical and behavioural effects on humans and is an
      important cue for the ‘body clock’ or circadian rhythms. Lack of exposure
      to daylight, due to night shift work, can give rise to ‘shift lag’,
      (displacement of the body clock).

    <p>
      Having too little to do or having a job that does not offer stimulation,
      variety or challenge can also be sources of stress, causing ‘rust-out’ (as
      opposed to the ‘burn out’ caused by over-stimulation).
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Rust-out’, due to boredom, and lack of stimulation in the workplace can
      be prevented by changing the ‘micro’ work environment through
      job-enrichment e.g. increasing workers’ skills, providing more autonomy in
      the job and more opportunities for decision making.
    </p>
    <p>
      By improving the amount of skill variety, task identity, task
      significance, autonomy and feedback, it is possible to improve both
      motivation and job performance and reduce levels of stress.

      <p>Fatigue</p>
    </div>
    <!--H4 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Fatigue may be considered to be a temporary inability or a decrease in
      ability or a strong disinclination to respond to a situation, because of
      inadequate recuperation from previous mental, emotional or physical over-
      activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The symptoms of fatigue may include muscle pain, difficulty in
      concentrating, or sleepiness and the resulting decline in mental and / or
      physical performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HSE considers that a fatigued person will be less alert, less able to
      process information, will have slower reaction times and less interest in
      working compared to a person who is not fatigued. These issues together
      with memory lapses, absent-mindedness, decreased awareness, lack of
      attention, underestimation of risk, reduced coordination etc. can lead to
      errors and accidents, ill-health and injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most occupational fatigue symptoms result from disturbances of sleep and
      the circadian rhythm / biological clock. Reports of fatigue are higher
      among shift-workers than among day-workers and highest among night
      workers.
    </p>
    <p>The main causes of fatigue are:</p>

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

      </ul>

    <p>
      Workload is also a consideration in that workers are more easily fatigued
      if their work is machine-paced, complex or monotonous.

      <p>Stress</p>
    </div>
    <!--H4 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Stress is the adverse reaction people have to excessive pressures or other
      types of demand placed on them. There is a clear distinction between
      pressure, which can create a ‘buzz’ and be a motivating factor, and
      stress, which can occur when this pressure becomes excessive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stress can result in a range of effects that can affect an individual’s
      physical well-being, increase the likelihood of human error in the
      workplace and impact negatively upon the organisation.

      As well as its effect on individuals it must be noted that stress also
      effects the organisation at large. Stressed employees’ availability for
      work will be diminished, as will their capacity for work and the quality
      of their work. This will lead to ‘organisational ill-health’.

      People bring their personal characteristics and attributes to their work.
      Individual characteristics influence behaviour in complex and significant
      ways and may be strengths or weaknesses depending on the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some negative personal characteristics may be addressed by ergonomic
      design; some characteristics such as skills and attitudes, may be changed
      or enhanced by training and development; and others such as personality
      are relatively fixed and cannot be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The below figure models the relationships between some of the key
      variables and individual behaviour. Note this sis a relatively simple
      model shown for completeness. The syllabus does not require further
      investigation of all of them but it is worth noting that a Certificate
      level of understanding is assumed prior learning.

      <p>Attitude</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      An attitude represents an individual’s degree of like or dislike (positive
      or negative view) of an object, where the object may be a person, place,
      thing, or event.
    </p>
    <p>
      An attitude involves thoughts, feelings and predispositions to act towards
      an object. (i.e. involves the head, the heart and the hands!).
    </p>
    <p>
      Attitudes can be modified as a consequence of feedback on behaviour and
      are also influenced by the prevailing attitude of a peer group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early understanding of the relationship between attitude and behaviour
      was often stated as an ABC model, i.e. the attitude prompted behaviour,
      which led to a consequence. A favourable consequence reinforces the
      attitude and subsequent behaviour and an unfavourable consequence weakened
      the attitude. However research failed to prove a direct causal
      relationship between attitudes and behaviours.
    </p>

        <p>
          Richard La Piere’s (1934) article “Attitudes versus Actions” explored
          racist attitudes and behaviours in California. He visited 251 hotels
          and restaurants with a Chinese companion and was refused entry only
          once. A later questionnaire asking the same establishments if they
          would accept Chinese guests received 128 responses with 92% responding
          ‘No’.Clearly other contextual factors meant that the behaviour
          wasdemonstrably different to the predominant racist attitude.
        </p>
      </div>

    <!--Blue Box - Single Paragraph End-->

    <p>
      The causal link between attitude and behaviour is much weaker than the
      reverse link between behaviour and attitude. When a person’s behaviour
      changes and becomes incompatible with the corresponding attitude a state
      of discomfort, known as “cognitive dissonance” occurs. To resolve the
      discomfort the attitude changes to be consistent with the newly-adopted
      behaviour.

    <p>Risk perception has been discussed at length in section 2.6</p>

      <p>Skills</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The knowledge, skills and abilities framework (KSA) is a common tool used
      by human resources professionals to match a workers qualities to a given
      role. In this context skills are the capabilities or proficiencies
      developed through training or hands-on experience, as opposed to abilities
      which are innate. Whereas knowledge is theoretical, skill relates to the
      practical application of that knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note the definition of skill compared to competence – which is the ability
      to conform to a required standard or competency which has a broader
      definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly it is important that workers are demonstrably capable of
      undertaking the tasks required of them. The more critical the task the
      greater the requirement for skilled, competent workers.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Habits</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Woods (2017) noted that modern social and personality psychology has paid
      scant attention to habits until relatively recently This is due to
      outdated historical research that placed habits in conflict with goals. In
      modern theory, habits are considered to be implicit context–response
      associations in memory that guides human responses in conjunction with
      goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early researchers proposed a variety of reinforcement-based models of
      habit. Thorndike’s laws (1911) highlighted learning through rewards and
      response repetition and Skinner’s (1938) work on operant conditioning also
      emphasized the importance of responding to rewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern research suggests that habits develop as people repeat an action
      for a reward. Through instrumental learning, implicit cognitive
      associations form between the recurring features of the action and the
      rewarded response. As habits strengthen, people naturally become less
      sensitive to rewards. Habits are not goal dependent. Habits are an
      important part of the brain’s framework, and account for around 40% of
      human behaviour. They may be performed quickly, efficiently, and rigidly,
      and with limited thought, allowing individuals to perform routine
      behaviours without needing to make small decisions every step of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allowing daily actions to be driven by routine offers certain benefits as
      it conserves mental reserves for concerns that require active
      consideration, but it also comes with drawbacks. Notably it can cause
      people to perform actions on autopilot when they should be paying
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting into good routine safety behaviours, such as pre-commencement
      checks or donning PPE at shift start-up can quickly become habit forming.
      Studies on habit formation indicate that a minimum of 21 days is required
      to form a new habit, whereas the median timeframe is 66 days.

    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Personality</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Personality is made up of a person’s unique characteristic pattern of
      thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Personality arises from within the
      individual and remains fairly consistent throughout life.
    </p>
    <p>Personality has certain fundamental characteristics, including:</p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Consistency:</span> People act in the same ways or
      similar ways in a variety of situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Psychological and physiological:</span> Personality
      is a psychological construct, but is influenced by biological processes
      and needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Impact upon behaviours:</span> Personality does not
      just influence behaviour; it causes people to act in certain ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Multiple expressions:</span> Personality is
      expressed in thoughts, feelings, close relationships and other social
      interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many models of the aspects of human personality. Costa and
      McCrae’s five factor model (also known as the Big 5 or OCEAN) identified
      five main aspects of personality as shown below.
