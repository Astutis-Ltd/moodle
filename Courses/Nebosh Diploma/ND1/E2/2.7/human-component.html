      The human body receives information through sensory receptors for sight,
      hearing, smell, taste, touch and proprioception. Vision is the dominant
      sense, followed by hearing, though sense of touch and kinaesthetic
      feedback are also important in the design of controls.

      The brain manages both low level processes to control basic sensori-motor
      responses, and higher level cognitive processing which allow for planning,
      problem solving and decision making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some models compare the brain to a computer system and refer to ‘online’
      and ‘offline’ processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Online processing</span> relates to decision-making
      whilst the control process is operational and are typically skill based
      actions involving fine-tuning of the physical control of a process.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Offline processing</span> tends to occur between
      operations and involves decision making and problem solving to refine
      processes going forward. Decisions of this type tend to be knowledge
      based.

    <p>
      The primary effectors are the means by which information is entered into
      the machine, i.e. the hands, the feet and the voice. The feet can effect
      simple controls such as the accelerator, brake and clutch in a car when
      driving.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hands have the most scope for effective control and offer a range of
      options for manipulating objects, from precision grips, for example,
      holding a pen between fingertip and thumb, to a power grip where a lever
      is grasped at the base of the fingers and palm.

      <p><strong>Controls</strong></p>
      <p>
        Effective human interaction with machines is dependent upon the design
        and construction of suitable controls which can be engaged by the
        effectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Controls can also provide direct feedback, for example, when turning a
        car steering wheel the level of resistance provides information about
        road conditions and/or tyre pressure.
      </p>
      <p>Control design is discussed in more detail later.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="background-color: #f6ecff; padding: 10px">
      <p><strong>The controlled process</strong></p>
      <p>
        The controlled process is what the machine does, for example, a pillar
        drill making holes in sheet metal or a nuclear fission reactor producing
        electricity in a power station.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style="background-color: #ecd9ff; padding: 10px">
      <p><strong>Display</strong></p>
      <p>
        Operating traditional machinery utilises information received directly
        from the control process and from feedback. Information is also provided
        indirectly through dials and gauges.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style="background-color: #f6ecff; padding: 10px">
      <p><strong>Control design</strong></p>
      <p>
        Anthropometric data should be used to determine appropriate dimensions
        for controls and the controls should be designed and positioned to
        operate in low stress postures with minimal pressure on body parts. The
        following variables should also be considered:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style="background-color: #ecd9ff; padding: 10px">
      <p><strong>Force</strong></p>
      <p>
        If high levels of force are required the design should allow for it to
        be applied easily, for example, through the use of a power grip design
        rather than a precision grip.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style="background-color: #f6ecff; padding: 10px">
      <p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
      <p>
        Accurate controls are engineered to ensure there is a high level of
        correspondence between the movement of the control and the response of
        the controlled process, for example, the movement of a steering wheel
        and the corresponding movement of the vehicle on the road.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style="background-color: #ecd9ff; padding: 10px">
      <p><strong>Layout</strong></p>
      <p>
        High priority controls should be located so that they are easily seen
        and easily accessed. (The optimum reach envelope). All controls should
        be within the zone of maximum reach.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style="background-color: #f6ecff; padding: 10px">
      <p><strong>Functional groupings</strong></p>
      <p>
        Controls with related functions should be grouped together. Care should
        be taken to ensure that operation of one control does not cause
        interference with adjacent controls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sequential controls should be laid out as per the operating sequence.
        Interlocks can be used to ensure that controls can only be operated in
        the correct sequence.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style="background-color: #ecd9ff; padding: 10px">
      <p><strong>Expectation</strong></p>
      <p>
        Cultural influences will need to be considered, for example, in Europe
        flicking a switch downwards turns the system on. In the United States of
        America the same action would switch the system off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Controls on similar machines will be expected to perform in a similar
        way.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style="background-color: #f6ecff; padding: 10px">
      <p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p>
      <p>
        The direction of movement of a control should be compatible with the
        movement of the corresponding display.

    </div>
    <div style="background-color: #ecd9ff; padding: 10px">
      <p><strong>Distinctiveness</strong></p>
      <p>
        Combinations of shape, colour, texture and size are used to provide
        effective means of distinguishing between controls.

              Geometric shapes can be used to distinguish between types of
              control, giving both visual and tactile cues. Research suggests
              operatives can cope with up to 12 different options on a control
              panel.

      As has been discussed ergonomic is as much about mental fit as it is about
      physical fit. Socio-technical systems should be designed to make best use
      of human skills and to compensate for human weaknesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standal (2013) identified seven key objective task complexity factors that
      can impact upon human performance as shown in table 2.23.

    <p>
      Note also the additional impacts that the organisation (through the
      imposition of time pressure); and the individual (through personal
      characteristics such as knowledge, training and personal attributes) can
      have on subjective task complexity.

      <p>Task analysis – Predicting and preventing error</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Task analysis is a “catch-all” term for a range of similar techniques that
      involve taking a task, activity or process and systematically breaking it
      down into its component steps or actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Industrial engineers use the approach to improve task efficiency; and
      ergonomists to identify and address potential for human failures.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general health and safety practice a job safety analysis (aka job step
      analysis or job hazard analysis) is often used to identify hazards and
      otential human errors at each action step in a process with a view to
      introducing corresponding preventive and / or protective measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using such reductionist (breaking down) techniques it is important to
      not lose sight of the whole. A holistic view can often lead to a top level
      solution that makes more sense overall than a series of lower level
      solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic stages of a job safety analysis can be remembered as
