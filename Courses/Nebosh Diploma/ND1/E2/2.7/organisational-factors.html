      <p>The effect of organisational factors on culture</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The HSE’s human factors model shows how leadership, culture, provision of
      resources etc impact upon behaviours at work. Leadership (as discussed in
      section 2.2) and culture are opposite sides of the same coin. It is, or
      should be, the organisation’s leaders that establish and drive core values
      and set the style and tone of expected behaviour. Simply speaking
      leadership should drive culture, which drives behaviour, which drives
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The standards of an organisation are typically the lowest standards that
      the senior leaders are willing to accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lack of leaders who have bought into the importance of effective
      health and safety management within the organisation, will mean that
      health and safety does not become established as a core value and the
      organisation does not develop or maintain appositive safety culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senior leadership commitment demonstrated by ‘walking the walk’, leading
      by example, making sure adequate resources are provided etc is essential
      as is driving those values and the commitment t them throughout all levels
      of the organisation.

      Flexible working patterns offer potential benefits to employers and
      employees. Employers might experience increased productivity and
      employment, whereas workers may experience greater control and
      flexibility, and in some cases, reduced stress. However, the increased
      adoption of flexible work and employment patterns may also pose potential
      challenges for health and safety including:

      The growth area of work over the past decade or so has been in teleworking

      much of the work is conducted from alternative locations such as the car
      and hotels. The potential health and safety issues relating to these forms

      people) are doing shift work ‘most of the time,’

      Early research into the effects of shift work revealed that around 10% of

          Circadian Rhythms - humans are active and perform best during the day

          rhythms) such as chemical and hormone release that influence body
          activity. Biological activity is reduced at night which creates a need
          for sleep. The body clock can be adjusted over a period of weeks or

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      From a traditional (command and control) management perspective clarity of
      policy and workplace standards is imperative. Workers must know what is
      expected of them and managers must know what standards to hold workers to
      account against. Lack of clarity and precision introduces potential for
      variability which is seen as a weakness providing potential for human
      failure. As discussed in section 2.5 the safety II view is that
      variability is as inevitable as the gaps between ‘work as prescribed’ and
      ‘work as done’ and preparing workers to be resilient and adaptable is the
      key to ongoing system success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The planning for implementation stage of the health and safety management
      system (HSMS) development requires effective risk assessment through the
      co-ordinated efforts of all members of the organisation. The required task
      analyses of work activities should consider the potential for human
      failures as per HSG48 and use ergonomic design principles to manage that
      potential to acceptable levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the ‘doing’ stage organising for health and safety requires appropriate
      arrangements are in place to address the 4 C’s of control, cooperation,
      communication and competence. Weaknesses in any of these areas is likely
      to increase the potential for human failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The back end of the system requires monitoring arrangements to be
      implemented to ensure that work is being undertaken safely, as expected.
      Proactive monitoring with appropriate timely interventions can have a
      significant impact on increasing positive behaviours in the workplace and
      thus reducing the likelihood of human failure.

    <p>
      Once a group norm has been established there is a tendency for group
      members to <span class="ast-bold">conform</span> to the norm, as a result
      of social or “peer pressure”. Peer group pressure arises where a group has
      established its values and normed its behaviours and will not tolerate
      group members expressing incompatible opinions or behaving differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formal and informal discussions with groups of workers such as safety
      committees, safety circles, departmental meetings etc may be affected if
      there is a reluctance to express different opinions.

    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Compliance</span> relates to responses to direct

      Research into group decision making has identified several interesting

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Group think:</span> A cohesive group can be unduly
      influenced by pressures to conform and comply. Situations may arise when
      the group become overly focused on agreement and unanimous decision at the
      expense of a realistic solution to the problem at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Group polarisation:</span> James Stoner (1961)
      identified that group decisions were often riskier than individual
      decisions, a phenomenon termed “risky shift”. Subsequent research has
      shown that group decisions may also shift towards an overly cautious /
      conservative decision. The polarisation of views has been attributed to
      the normative and informational influences of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Social loafing:</span> Most of the time people work
      harder in a group than they do as individuals, however some individuals
      may expect the other group members to manage without them and ease off and
      take a back seat. This is known as social loafing.

      <p>Communication mechanisms and their impact on human failure</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Spoken and written communication can be critical in maintaining safety.
      This can include general communications in the form of safety information;
      communications between team members or between different teams during
      operations or maintenance work; and emergency communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      All personnel require access to key information to help them safely
      negotiate the hazards in the workplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communications are particularly important in a wide range of safety
      critical tasks and activities such as lifting operations, emergency
      response, entry to confined spaces, as well as coordination of activities
      between different parties and organisations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key principles to be adopted for safety critical communications can be
      summarised as:

    <p>
      Failure of communication at shift handover has contributed to the cause of
      many industrial accidents including the Sellafield Beach Incident (1983)
      (not on syllabus) where highly radioactive waste liquor was discharged to
      sea, due to a failure of communication between shifts; and Piper Alpha
      1988.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effective communication is essential when a task and its associated
      responsibilities are handed over to another person or work team. This can
      occur at shift changeover, between shift and day workers, or between
      different functions of an organisation within a shift e.g. operations and
      maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of the handover is the accurate reliable communication of
      task-relevant information across shift changes or between teams to ensure
      continuity of safe and effective working.
    </p>
    <p>Effective handover consists of three elements:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          A period of preparation by out-going personnel;
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Handover where out-going and in-coming personnel communicate to
          exchange task-relevant information; and
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Cross-checking of information by in-coming personnel as they assume
          responsibility for the task.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      To ensure effective handovers it is essential that high risk handover
      situations are identified and that clear, effective handover procedures
      are in place. Al staff should understand the safety critical nature of
      shift handover and the importance of taking their part in the process
      seriously. Consideration should be given to the communication skills of
      those involved and additional training and support should be provided as
      required. When planning maintenance works all efforts should be made to
      ensure the work can be completed in a single shift, thus avoiding the need
      for a handover.
    </p>
    <p>Shift handover should be:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">Conducted face-to-face;</li>

        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Given as much time and resource as necessary.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Improvements should also be made by designing support equipment, such as
      logs and computer displays, with consideration of the operator’s needs;
      and involving the end-users when implementing any changes to existing
      communication methods at shift handover.
