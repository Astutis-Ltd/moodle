    <p>The definition of human factors used in HSG48 is:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        “Human factors refer to environmental, organisational and job factors,
        and human and individual characteristics which influence behaviour at
        work in a way which can affect health and safety.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      A simple way to view human factors is to think about three aspects: the
      individual, the job, and the organisation and how they impact on people’s
      health and safety-related behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The individual and the job come together to create a risk interface. The
      job takes place within the context of the organisational culture – this is
      often the greatest influence on workplace behaviour.

    <p>
      The literal interpretation of ergonomics is ‘law of work’ (from the Greek
      – Ergon = work and Nomos = natural law). The word was created by Professor
      Wojciech Jastrzebowski in Poland in 1857.
    </p>
    <p>
      World War II saw the birth of the science now referred to as ergonomics.
      As the design of aeroplanes and tanks etc. became increasingly
      sophisticated, it became increasingly important to consider the design of
      the operator / machinery interface to reduce the likelihood of human error
      and disastrous consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Hywell Murrell proposed the name ergonomics for the burgeoning
      new science at a meeting of the British Admiralty in 1949. The Ergonomic
      Society was then formed in the UK in 1952 and The Human Factors Society
      was formed in the US in 1957.
    </p>
    <p>
      The International Ergonomics Association (IEA 2000) defined ergonomics (or
      human factors) as:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">

        The scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of the
        interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the
        profession that applies theoretical principles, data and methods to
        design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system
        performance.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      The IEA has also defined three areas of specialisation within ergonomics:

    <p>
      Anthropometry translates literally as ‘the measurement of man’ (Greek –
      anthropos = man and metron = measure). Anthropometric data is used to
      specify the physical dimensions of work space and work equipment and
      ensures that the task is designed to fit the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natural variations of human populations have significant implications
      for the design of equipment etc. If the scale is from the smallest adult
      female to the largest adult male in a population, the male will be 30 to
      40% taller, 100% heavier, and 500% stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      In non-safety critical situations equipment design accommodates 90% of the
      population, based upon a normal distribution.

      Stature data for British adults was obtained during a 1981 survey
      conducted by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS). An
      example of an anthropometric table (Pheasant and Haslegrave, 2006) is
      shown in the below table.

    <p>
      An individual’s capacity to undertake physical work can be measured
      directly by examining maximal oxygen uptake (ability to take in O2 in the
      blood via the lungs), or indirectly by measuring heart rate. Heart rate is
      a reliable proxy measure of workload and is easily measured in the
      workplace (O2 uptake measurements require specialist laboratory
      equipment).
    </p>
    <p>
      A moderate work rate would see young, healthy workers utilising
      approximately 25-30% of their maximal aerobic power (oxygen uptake) (heart
      rate of 110 beats per minute) over an eight hour work shift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exceeding these limits can lead to fatigue and loss of coordination, with
      consequential errors and injuries. Environmental factors such as
      temperature, humidity and air velocity need to be considered carefully as
      they are likely to negatively impact upon the performance of individuals
      doing strenuous work.
