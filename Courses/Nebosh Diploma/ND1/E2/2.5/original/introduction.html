    <p>
      Just as ways of working have continued to evolve since the time of the
      Industrial revolution, so have workplace hazards and approaches to the
      understanding and management of associated risks.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Andrew Hale and others (1988) described this evolution as the
      three ages of safety management. The ‘first age’ from the onset of the
      Industrial Revolution at which time safety was seen as an engineering or
      technical problem, initially dealing with issues associated with the use
      of steam engines and the machinery they powered. The ‘second age’ arose
      following the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 when human factors
      thinking became popular and dominated approaches throughout the 1980’s. By
      the mid 1980’s thinking was evolving again, into the ‘third age’, the age
      of safety management. By this stage thinking had broadened beyond
      engineering and human factors to incorporate organisational and cultural
      factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Ian Glendon et al (2006) proposed that each period of
      development built on what went before, rather than leaving it behind,
      referring to a ‘fourth age’ or the ‘integration age’ of safety where
      previous ways of thinking are reflected upon as multiple, more complex
      perspectives develop and evolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glendon further suggested that we are moving into a ‘fifth age’ of safety,
      the ‘adaptive age’ which transcends all other ages without discounting
      them, whilst introducing the concept of ‘adaptation’, as informed by
      Professor Erik Hollnagel’s discussions around resilience engineering and
      ‘efficiency-thoroughness trade-offs’ (ETTO – not on syllabus) (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
      Hollnagel himself (2014) refers to everything that went before as Safety I
      and his approach as Safety II whereas Professor Sidney Dekker(2015) refers
      to traditional approaches as ‘modernist safety’ and his ‘new era’ approach
      as ‘safety differently’.
