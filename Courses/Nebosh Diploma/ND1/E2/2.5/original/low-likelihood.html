        Low likelihood / high consequence events<br />

    <br />
    <p>
      Proponents of proactive approaches criticisms of traditional safety
      includes the view that low likelihood, high consequence events are
      unlikely to be considered in traditional safety as event have not
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      This would seem to be a rather narrow view. The third edition of HSG65
      (HSE, 2013) clearly states that health and safety risks from things that
      happen very infrequently but with catastrophic effects (high-hazard,
      low-frequency events, such as an oil refinery explosion) would be
      high-priority in a risk profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effective risk evaluation of such events has long been acknowledged as
      challenging. The UK Governments Blackett Review of High Impact Low
      Probability Risks published it’s findings in 2011 The most notable
      over-arching factor in these recommendations is the repeated need for the
      inclusion of external experts and readiness to consider unlikely risks.
      Additionally, the report makes clear that behavioural matters and the role
      of social science in risk management needs to be enhanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dekker’s view (2012) is that traditional safety approaches drive a
      preoccupation with high-frequency / low-consequence things such as not
      wearing safety glasses or having coffee in a cup without a lid. Dekker
      believes that focusing on these relatively irrelevant things and being
      able to show the paperwork on it creates an artificial sense of safety and
      safety culture whilst losing sight of what is important and safety
      critical and accidentally ‘blowing stuff up’.

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Resilience</strong></p>
    <p>
      Thomas Tredgold, an early 19th century English engineer, first used the
      word ‘resilience’ to describe a property of timber, and to explain why
      some types of wood were able to accommodate sudden and severe loads
      without breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early 1970s the term was used as a synonym for stress resistance in
      psychological studies of children. It soon became more broadly used in
      psychology, and in 2007 was defined by Tisseron as: “The capacity to
      withstand traumatic situations and the ability to use a trauma as the
      start of something new”.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a resilience engineering perspective the focus is on resilient system
      performance. Hollnagel et al (2010) defined resilience engineering as “The
      intrinsic ability of a system to adjust its functioning prior to, during,
      or following changes and disturbances, so that it can sustain required
      operations under both expected and unexpected conditions.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that changes may be positive as well as negative and it is important
      that systems can respond effectively to opportunities as well as threats,
      stresses and negative disturbances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hollnagel (2012) noted that as work systems are larger and more complex
      than ever before with many more details to consider, accurately describing
      systems in detail is an impossible task. Hollnagel suggests it is time to
      abandon the idea that ‘work as imagined’ will correspond to ‘work as
      done’; and to recognise that for work to succeed it is necessary that
      performance is variable or flexible rather than rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      As mentioned previously it is essential that people are developed to be
      resilient within well-designed systems and are able to react and adapt to
      system changes to keep the system working safely, as intended.
    </p>
    <br />

    />
    <p></p>
    <p>
      According to the logic of Safety-I, the goal of ‘safety’, can be achieved
      by constraining all kinds of performance variability. Examples of
      frequently used constraints are selection, training, authorisations,
      restrictions, barriers, procedures, standardisation, rules, and
      regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hollnagel’s Safety II perspective is that all human activity (individually
      and / or collectively) is variable in the sense that it is adjusted to the
      conditions. As discussed earlier, in the context of increasingly complex
      socio-technical systems, recognising the variability of work (mismatches
      between work as described and work as done) and preparing workers to be
      able to effectively respond to variation is essential. Variability is a
      strength, or even a necessity, rather than a liability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dekker is also of the view that workers must use their experience and
      judgement to manage the realities of work, such as design glitches and
      poor organisation. Tightly controlling behaviour and preventing workers
      from using their discretion and knowledge to deal with issues is
      considered to create an environment in which small problems can escalate
      into something more catastrophic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hollnagel identified three main motivations for people to adjust or vary
      their performance:

    </p>

    <p style="color: #3e3eff; font-size: 11pt">Traditional</p>

    <p>
      Safety II advocates fundamental criticism of traditional safety is that
      the approach is philosophically flawed in focusing on the absence of risk
      rather than the presence of safety. Disciples of ‘safety differently’
      believe modern approaches should be more people focused and seek to praise
      the positive rather than criticise the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Hollnagel’s primary criticisms of traditional safety is that it is
      ‘reactive’ though the terms is not used narrowly in the traditional way to
      refer to after the event but to learning from what goes wrong, or could go
      wrong rather than learning from what goes right.
    </p>
    <p>
      A key principle of safety differently is that safety should be an ethical
      responsibility, not a bureaucratic activity. Dekker’s view of traditional
      safety is that it has lost focus on what is important and become overly
      bureaucratic and bogged down with excessive paperwork focused on
      demonstrating system and legal compliance. Dekker is also critical of the
      top-down authoritarian stance taken by many organisations where rules are
      imposed on workers and systems implemented to force compliance.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Proactive</strong></p>
    <p>
      Criticisms of Safety II are more likely to be in response to its perceived
      criticism of Safety I rather than any fundamental disagreement with the
      idea that resilience engineering approaches may have a part to play in
      safety management. The major criticism of safety differently is the lack
      of empirical evidence and peer reviewed research to demonstrate its impact
      (Cooper, 2020).
    </p>
    <p>
      Hollnagels resilience engineering approach requires people to be able to
      anticipate system changes as well as being able to react and adapt as
      necessary to keep the system working safely, as intended. This is seen as
      proactive and criticised as it suggests that workers need to be able to
      predict the future. The same assertion could, of course, also be levelled
      at traditional risk assessment approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another stated limitation is that organisations may be averse to trying a
      new approach. This is a typical example of organisational inertia or
      resistance to change. People tend to be resistant to change because it is
      stressful, and organisations are no different and often strive to maintain
      the status quo. The challenges of managing organisational change are
      addressed in Element 7.

    </p>
    <p>
      Dekker’s view (2012) of safety culture is of
      <em
        >“a very empowering idea, shifting our focus onto the context
        surrounding people’s work”</em
      >
      that has unfortunately been accompanied by burgeoning safety bureaucracy
      with organisations deploying vast systems for loss prevention, safety
      management, auditing etc in pursuit of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dekker states that traditional approaches to safety culture are
      plateauing, with typically lower returns for each new initiative. Dekker
      believes that driving effective safety cultures forward requires
      organisations to:

    <p>
      Since James Reason (1997) modelled the concept of a ‘just culture’ it has
      been generally accepted as a foundation stone for an effective, positive
      safety culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dekker (2012) considers Reason’s model to be retributive as it “asks which
      rule has been broken, who did it, how bad was the infraction, so what does
      the person deserve?” and advocates an evolution to a restorative just
      culture model which would ask:
      <em
        >“Who has been hurt or potentially hurt? What are their needs? Whose
        obligation is it to meet those needs?”</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Hollnagel considers notions of safety culture and just culture to be
      artefacts of a ‘safety I view’ still focused on the ‘causality credo’ and
      why things go wrong. He does however advocate a fair management culture in
      the context of the safety II or resilience engineering perspective.
      Hollnagels’s ‘fair culture’ recognises that work is based on performance
      adjustments whether things go right or wrong and seeks to resolve the
      potential, and actual, conflict between what is explicit (or prescribed)
      and what is implicit (or tacit).
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that the legal systems that employing organisations operate within
      often require the establishment of blame to obtain compensation it is
      unclear how these evolutions could occur in practise.
