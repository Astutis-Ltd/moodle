    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>
      Although notions of ‘Safety II’ and ‘Safety Differently’ are often grouped
      together Hollnagel considers that the terms refer to two completely
      different ideas.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dekker explains that ‘Safety differently’ is about relying on people’s
      expertise, insights and the dignity of work as actually done to improve
      safety and efficiency, and about halting or pushing back on the
      ever-expanding bureaucratisation and compliance of work. Hollnagel
      considers this to be a ‘Safety I’ approach as its focus is still on the
      elimination or reduction of harm, even if it is done in a more
      constructive and effective way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hollnagel considers that ‘Safety II’ is not about safety at all, but about
      how to develop and maintain the potentials of an organisation to function
      under varying conditions so that the number of intended and acceptable
      outcomes is as high as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hollnagel’s view is that as technical and socio-technical systems have
      continued to evolve with ever more powerful information technology,
      systems and work environments have gradually become more intractable
      (difficult to deal with), and the bi-modal approach of ‘Safety I’ no
      longer fits.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p style="color: #3e3eff">
      <strong>Focus on the presence of positives</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The ‘Safety II’ approach changes the definition of safety from ‘avoiding
      that something goes wrong’ to ‘ensuring that everything goes right’ – or
      more precisely to the ability to succeed under varying conditions, so that
      the number of intended and acceptable outcomes (in other words, successful
      everyday activities) is as high as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basis for safety and safety management therefore becomes an
      understanding of everyday activities and why things go right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safety II assumes that systems work because workers are able to adjust
      what they do in response to the conditions of work. Workers need to be
      able to identify and overcome design flaws and functional glitches by
      adapting their performance accordingly. If they can detect when something
      is about to go wrong, they can intervene and keep things on track. This
      ‘performance variability’ is seen as a positive where the variability
      represents the adjustments that form the basis of ongoing safety and
      productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Safety II philosophy and vision of success and failure is presented in
      the below figure for comparison with Safety I.

      /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Performance variability is seen as essential in ensuring the ongoing
      functioning of socio-technical systems unless they are very simple
      systems.

      <strong>Devolve, declutter, decentralise</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dekker (2012) coined the term ‘safety differently’ when approached by a
      group of organisations to help them improve after their safety performance
      had plateaued, despite ever more bureaucracy and compliance requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Safety differently’ is said to be about relying on people’s expertise,
      insights and the dignity of work as actually done to improve safety and
      efficiency, whilst pushing back on the ever-expanding bureaucratisation
      and compliance of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safety improvements (i.e. reductions in fatalities and serious injury
      rates) have flatlined despite a vast expansion of compliance with its
      associated paperwork and bureaucratic accountability which generates
      significant costs and non-productive time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dekker’s work with three Australian organisations (Origin Energy,
      Queensland Health and Woolworths) in devolving, decluttering, and
      decentralising their safety bureaucracy delivered interesting findings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Origin Energy made significant cost-savings by reducing the size of their
      Safety Management System by 90% by making safety a field-focused,
      operational issue, cutting centralised safety staff and reducing the
      bureaucratic accountability requirements imposed on engineers in the
      field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queensland Health stopped assembling state-wide caregivers centrally to
      tell them how to do a particular procedure. They distributed experts
      throughout the state, using local process simulations as tools for
      discovery and sensemaking, and asking people what they needed and wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Woolworths Supermarkets ran a randomized controlled trial, taking
      everything related to safety out of a group of stores and telling the
      store manager ‘don’t hurt anyone.’ Injuries went down, innovations went up
      and a deep sense of ownership blossomed. One store in that group won the
      annual safety prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      The organisations each discovered that much of their compliance and
      bureaucracy was self-inflicted, going far beyond legal compliance. The
      majority of the permits, checklists, rules, guidance and procedures used
      were driven internally or by contracting arrangements to other
      organisations. There were ‘too many cooks in the rule-making kitchen’ with
      no calls for evidence of the value of the rule. It was easy to add rules
      but almost impossible to take them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The focus of their efforts shifted from documentation to trusting and
      empowering their people. They resisted the urge to centralise, standardise
      and control everything their people do, and instead focussed on harnessing
      autonomy, mastery and purpose as drivers for people’s motivation to do the
      right thing.
    </p>
    <br />

    <!--SUB-SUB-HEAD-->
    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>People are the solution</strong></p>
    <p>
      Since the ‘second age’ of safety management in the 1980s people have been
      seen as the weak link in socio-technical systems and the most likely point
      of failure as evidenced by decades of research into human factors, human
      failure and behavioural safety etc. Historical issues with blame culture
      and the need to develop more just cultures reinforce the notion that
      people are the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Hollnagel (2013) and Dekker (2012) have made capital out of comparing
      their respective approaches against traditional safety / safety I. In both
      comparisons the general point is made, although in fundamentally different
      ways that in traditional safety people are the problem whereas in safety
      II and safety differently, they are the solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dekker proposes that people are not the problem to control but the
      solution, advocating that employers evolve from attempting to control
      workers by forcing compliance with rules but instead understand how the
      workers create success on a daily basis, and harness their skills,
      competencies and common-sense to build a safer workplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hollnagel’s view is that with the increasing complexity of socio-technical
      systems it is imperative that that people are developed to be resilient,
      to deal well with the efficiency-thoroughness trade-off (ETTO principle –
      not on syllabus) and to be able to react and adapt to system changes to
      keep the system working safely, as intended.
