        Traditional safety (safety I / modernist safety)<br />

    <p>
      As can be seen from the introduction approaches to health and safety
      management have evolved significantly since the 1970’s and continue to do
      so. All the proponents of the more recent ‘proactive’ safety management
      models acknowledge that there is much of the traditional approaches to be
      admired and continued with but that additional approaches are also
      required.
    </p>
    <p>
      As has been discussed elsewhere, traditional safety management has
      significant proactive elements, notably risk assessment and management and
      the use of proactive monitoring data to provide leading indicators of
      performance.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Criticisms of traditional safety should be considered holistically,
      otherwise there is a danger of exaggerating the weaknesses and ignoring
      the positives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traditional view of safety is framed by reference to its opposite, the
      absence of safety and is typically defined by the absence of accidents and
      incidents, or as the ‘freedom from unacceptable risk’, or ‘a state where,
      as few things as possible go wrong’, or where the number of adverse
      outcomes is kept ‘as low as is reasonably practicable’.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, the historical focus of safety research and safety management
      has largely focussed on unsafe system operation rather than on safe
      operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hollnagel (2013 / 2014) captures the ‘philosophy’ of traditional safety in
      the below figure.

      As can be seen this is based on a bimodal / binary view of work activity
      in which work is either successfully completed or fails. Where work goes
      wrong because of a technical, organisational or human failure the focus is
      inevitable on understanding the root causes to disable the cause-effect
      links and prevent similar future occurrences.
    </p>
    <p>The two main concerns with this approach are that:</p>

      As frontline staff are the last ones to ‘touch the system’ before it
      breaks it is they who are most likely to be held responsible or blamed
      when things go wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor James Reason (1997) and others developed the concept of ‘just
      culture’ to address the issue of unfairly blaming workers for workplace
      accidents (blame culture). A ‘just culture’ is regarded as an essential
      part of the foundations of a safety culture. Reason defined a just culture
      as “an atmosphere of trust in which people are encouraged (even rewarded)
      for providing essential safety related information, but in which they are
      also clear about where the line must be drawn between acceptable and
      unacceptable behaviour.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept was subsequently embedded in EU legislation, notably Article 2
      of Regulation 691/2010 on air navigation services which defines it as “a
      culture in which frontline operators and others are not punished for
      actions, omissions or decisions taken by them which are commensurate with
      their experience and training, but where gross negligence, wilful
      violations and destructive acts are not tolerated.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The counter view from Safety II is that variability in modern
      socio-technical work systems is inevitable and that the systems continue
      to work effectively when workers can adapt to variations and adjust their
      ways of working to match changing work conditions. Workers therefore are a
      strength in their system and their adaptability typically keeps things
      working well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Safety II view of traditional safety as ‘reactive’ is because it is
      based on identifying things that have gone wrong (through incident
      investigation) or things that could go wrong (through risk assessment)
      with the focus on addressing root causes to prevent similar future
      occurrences. In contrast Safety II is deemed proactive because it focuses
      on ensuring that as much as possible goes right.
