    <p>
      The idea that how people think that work is done and how it is actually
      done are two different things dates back to the onset of ergonomics. In
      the 1940’s research into the impact of cockpit design on aircraft
      accidents considered ‘imagination vs operation’. In the 1950’s the French
      ergonomists Ombredanne and Faverge realised that the analysis of work had
      to consider both work as prescribed in procedures etc (le travail
      prescrit), and the observation of work actually done (le travail réalisé).
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowadays four basic varieties of work are typically considered: ‘work as
      imagined’, ‘work as prescribed’, ‘work as disclosed’ and ‘work as done’ as
      illustrated in the below figure. The varieties of human work overlap in
      parts with areas of commonality, and areas of difference. Hence the
      importance of considering all four.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      When thinking about how we or others work we use our imagination. ‘‘work
      as imagined’’ is the work that we imagine others do and the work that we
      imagine we or others might do, now or in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imagination of human work takes place at different levels within
      organisations. Senior management and middle management, along with
      non-operational specialists and support staff, will all have an
      imagination of the work of operational staff; and operational staff will
      have an imagination of the work of all of the above.
    </p>
    <p>
      These imaginations, or mental models, will be wrong in various ways, e.g
      they may be over-simplified, incomplete or incorrect.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Work as imagined’ is influenced by the other three varieties of work,
      which each have their limitations:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          past experience of ‘work as done’(Useful but can quickly become
          outdated);
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          knowledge and understanding of ‘work as prescribed’ (Often over or
          under-specified and unrealistic); and
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          exposure to ‘work as disclosed’ (Often partial and biased).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      ‘Work as imagined’ also applies to what we think we would do in a
      scenario, which may well be different to what we would really do. As
      Hollnagel (2016) stated “‘work as done’ differs from what we imagine we
      would do in the same situation, but thinking about it from afar and
      assuming more or less complete knowledge.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Where decisions about the work of others are made by those whose imagined
      view of work is incorrect, ‘work as imagined’ can become very problematic,
      leading to badly designed work and work environments, and unintended
      consequences, including adaptations to ‘work as done’ to overcome
      constraints and to work around other unintended consequences.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Work as prescribed</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      ‘Work as prescribed’ is the formalisation or specification of ‘work as
      imagined’, or ‘work as done’ or ‘work as disclosed’, or some combination
      of the three. It takes on a number of forms in organisations, including
      task-oriented such as procedures and checklists or job-oriented (e.g.
      rules and job descriptions).
    </p>
    <p>
      Work is often prescribed by more senior members of an organisation who are
      often distanced from operational activity and have little contact with the
      front line, policy makers or external organisations, such as regulators.
      This distance can account for significant differences between an
      organisation’s policy and practise. ‘work as prescribed’ is often assumed
      to be the safe and correct way to work and is often the ultimate arbiter
      of whether performance is satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Work as prescribed’ will be subject to risk assessment and control as
      well as other measures to control and standardise ‘work as done’. These
      controls may involve soft constraints such as rules, which are possible to
      overcome and hard constraints such as forcing functions, which are
      difficult or impossible to overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except for extremely simple tasks it is practically impossible to
      prescribe all aspects of human work, even when the work is
      well-understood. There are many ways in which work can be done so even
      well prescribed work can and will probably be done in other ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pre-conditions for, and conditions of, work cannot always be forseen
      or guaranteed. Assumed system conditions for staffing levels, competency,
      equipment, procedures, time etc are often somewhat more optimal than those
      found in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is often impossible to articulate in a linear written form the precise
      way that work is done so that the instructions are useable and easy to
      follow.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Work as disclosed</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      ‘Work as disclosed’ is the way that work is talked or written about. This
      is typically based on a partial version of one or more of the other
      varieties of human work but in addition the message is tailored for its
      purpose or objective and to be palatable, as expected and understood by
      the audience. It is often based on what we want and are prepared to say in
      the context of what is expected and imagined consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Work as disclosed’ differs from ‘work as prescribed’ when prescribed work
      does not provide a good basis for explaining how things work. (As
      mentioned earlier, it may be under or over-specified, or just not how
      things are really done). In such circumstances a supervisor might explain
      to a newcomer ‘how things work around here’ (work as done), in a summary
      form, or in a way that is very different to how work is officially
      prescribed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Work as disclosed’ also differs from ‘work as imagined’ because what we
      think or believe may be different to what we are prepared to say. This can
      be significant when communicating with outsiders such as regulators or
      auditors, or senior managers.
    </p>
    <p>
      People will sometimes modify or limit what they say about ‘work as done’
      based on consequences. In an environment where people are punished for
      trade-offs, workarounds, and compromises, which the staff believe to be
      necessary to meet demand, then the overlap between ‘work as disclosed’ and
      ‘work as done’ may be deliberately reduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cultural anthropologist Dr Margaret Mead was often credited with
      saying “What people say, what people do, and what they say they do are
      entirely different things.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In an organisation with a fair and trusting culture there will be a big
      overlap between ‘work as disclosed’ and ‘work as done’.
    </p>

      <p>Work as done</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      ‘Work as done’ is actual activity – what people do. It takes place in an
      environment that is often not as imagined, with a broad range of
      influencing variables which can all have unintended consequences,
      including:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">multiple, shifting goals,</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          variable and often unpredictable demand,
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          degraded resources (staffing, competency, equipment, procedures, and
          time), and
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          systems of constraints, punishments, and incentives.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      ‘Work as done’ is mostly impossible to prescribe precisely and is achieved
      by adjustments, variations, trade-offs and compromises that are necessary
      to meet demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaps between ‘work as prescribed’ and ‘work as done’ may be known and
      accepted and even encouraged – at least implicitly – at supervisory and
      local management levels, so long as demand is met.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the risks of disclosing all aspects of ‘work as done’, workers
      may keep aspects of it secret, or protect their working environment so as
      not to expose it. Aside from the risk of sanctions, the reason for this is
      a suspicion that if a decision maker sees a snapshot of ‘work as done’,
      then they may generalise from that snapshot and look to change systems,
      work-patterns, or resources in pursuit of increased efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Work as done’ can be examined via observation, but this is challenging as
      if workers now what should be done, they are likely to perform under
      observation. The work may also be difficult to understand or unsafe to
      observe.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Work as done’ is the most important and yet most neglected variety of
      human work. It is the variety that outsiders (those who do not do the
      work) pay least attention to. Much attention is paid to the other
      varieties of work, and this would not be a problem if it were not for the
      fact that these other varieties are so often mistaken for or used as a
      proxy for the real thing: ‘work as done’.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hollnagel (2016) noted that “We lack models based on what people actually
      do, on the recurrent patterns of behaviour.”

      <p>Conclusion</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The early ergonomists were right. The analysis of work cannot be limited
      to work as prescribed in procedures etc (le travail prescrit), nor to the
      observation of work actually done (le travail réalisé). Similarly, it
      cannot be limited to work as we imagine it, nor work as people talk about
      it. Consideration must be given to all four varieties of human work to
      provide a holistic understanding of the reality of work.
