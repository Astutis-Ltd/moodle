      Sensory information must be organised into meaningful units before it can
      be interpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research into visual perception (which has been studied in much greater
      detail than perception of other sensory data) has shown that information
      is primarily organised through pattern recognition. In the 1930s the
      Gestalt psychologists identified the ‘laws’ or principles of perceptual
      organisation.

    <p>
      Many researchers have suggested that pattern recognition is the basis of
      perception. Two major theories have been proposed:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Template matching theory</span> suggests that
      ‘templates’ stored in the memory for any given pattern or shape. When a
      new object is seen it is matched with an existing template as an
      indication of what the pattern represents. Template matching uses a ‘top
      down’ approach to explain object perception by matching it with stored
      information. The major problem with this approach is that patterns cannot
      be identified unless they have already been stored in memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Distinctive feature analysis</span> has formed the
      basis of much research into pattern perception. The approach suggests that
      the whole form of the pattern is less significant than crucial features
      which always occur in the target character regardless of other variables.
      This is a ‘bottom up’ approach in that it is stimulus driven and not
      memory driven. Challenged to identify a fruit that is green in colour and
      round in shape most people would recognise the distinctive features of an
      apple!
    </p>
    <p>
      The phenomenon of seeing patterns that do not actually exist, such as
      faces in clouds, or the man in the moon, is called apophenia.

    <p>
      The state of mental readiness for action is known as ‘set’ and it enables
      an individual to anticipate what is coming and act accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perception can be ‘set’ by various factors including: attitudes and
      prejudices, emotional state, and motivation, though expectation is the
      most significant.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Bruner’s research in the 1950s showed how strongly expectation could
      influence perception in a simple study showing people either numbers or
      letters, in a series, one at a time. An ambiguous figure that could be
      seen as a 13 or a B was then shown. All who had been shown a series of
      numbers saw it as 13, whereas those who had viewed letters saw a B.

      Most people would expect a dial to work clockwise, a switch to flick down
      for ‘on’, or the cold tap to be on the right.

      <p>Stereotypes</p>

    <p>
      A stereotype is an expectation about the characteristics, attributes, or
      behaviours of members of certain groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Social identity theory suggests that individuals need to map and define
      their identity in the context of group membership, and uphold the values
      of their group relative to others. Thus stereotypes are formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stereotypes tend to be more focused than categories such as: age, sex,
      race, religion, politics and occupation, and are based upon comparisons of
      average or typical characteristics in one group against another.

      HSE research has identified eight distinct factors that will influence an
      individual’s perception of risk:

        <p>
          Warnings about the link between smoking and lung cancer have been
          ineffective in stopping people smoking, because the time lag between
          smoking and the onset of lung cancer can be up to 40 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          If workers in a chemical plant were instructed to evacuate the
          workplace because of a leak of a toxic substance that posed the same
          level of risk but with imminent effects they would not hesitate.

        <p>
          Many people experience difficulty in understanding and interpreting
          statistical probabilities, thus there is the need to introduce
          additional qualitative characteristics to enable the conceptualisation
          of risk.

        <p>
          Individual differences and situational factors can interact and prompt
          risk taking behaviours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Researchers that emphasise the significance of the individual
          variables have identified links between maturity, personality types
          and risk taking behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          One theory suggests that individuals are equipped with ‘risk
          thermostats’, and that safety interventions do not affect the setting
          of the thermostat. Regardless of workplace controls the individual
          will behave in a way that maintains the level of risk with which he
          was originally content.

          When people feel in control of a risk they don’t feel stressed by it.
          This has been shown to be a key factor in the acceptability of risk.

          Research has shown that there is truth in the old adage ‘familiarity
          breeds contempt’. People tend to underestimate familiar risks and
          overestimate unfamiliar risks.

        <p>
          The way risk based data is presented (or framed) has been shown to
          introduce significant biases. Changing the description of a risk from
          positive to negative (i.e. talk about costs rather than benefits, or
          losses rather than gains) will have a measurable effect on observed
          behaviour.

        <p class="ast-bold">Perceptions of vulnerability</p>
        <p>
          People with the perception of low vulnerability or invulnerability (to
          the consequences of smoking, drink driving, sexual activity etc.) are
          not likely to modify their behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people have an ‘unrealistic optimism’, and assume that the
          harmful consequences will happen to someone else. This makes them more
          willing to take risks in all areas of their lives, including the
          workplace. Young men, in particular, may be prone to feeling
          invulnerable.

        <p>
          Workplace studies have shown workers to perceive the risk associated
          with water based pesticides to be lower than solvent based, because
          water is natural and inert, and must therefore be lower risk than
          solvent. This is irrational as it does not consider the risk of the
          pesticide itself.
