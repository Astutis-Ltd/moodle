      Sensory information must be organised into meaningful units before it can
      be interpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research into visual perception (which has been studied in much greater
      detail than perception of other sensory data) has shown that information
      is primarily organised through pattern recognition. In the 1930s the
      Gestalt psychologists identified the ‘laws’ or principles of perceptual
      organisation.

      Many researchers have suggested that pattern recognition is the basis of
      perception. Two major theories have been proposed:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Template matching theory</strong> suggests that ‘templates’ stored
      in the memory for any given pattern or shape. When a new object is seen it
      is matched with an existing template as an indication of what the pattern
      represents. Template matching uses a ‘top down’ approach to explain object
      perception by matching it with stored information. The major problem with
      this approach is that patterns cannot be identified unless they have
      already been stored in memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Distinctive feature analysis</strong> has formed the basis of much
      research into pattern perception. The approach suggests that the whole
      form of the pattern is less significant than crucial features which always
      occur in the target character regardless of other variables. This is a
      ‘bottom up’ approach in that it is stimulus driven and not memory driven.
      Challenged to identify a fruit that is green in colour and round in shape
      most people would recognise the distinctive features of an apple!
    </p>
    <p>
      The phenomenon of seeing patterns that do not actually exist, such as
      faces in clouds, or the man in the moon, is called apophenia.
    </p>
    <br />

    <!--SUB-SUB-HEAD-->
    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Perceptual set</strong></p>
    <p>
      The state of mental readiness for action is known as ‘set’ and it enables
      an individual to anticipate what is coming and act accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perception can be ‘set’ by various factors including: attitudes and
      prejudices, emotional state, and motivation, though expectation is the
      most significant.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Bruner’s research in the 1950s showed how strongly expectation could
      influence perception in a simple study showing people either numbers or
      letters, in a series, one at a time. An ambiguous figure that could be
      seen as a 13 or a B was then shown. All who had been shown a series of
      numbers saw it as 13, whereas those who had viewed letters saw a B.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people would expect a dial to work clockwise, a switch to flick down
      for ‘on’, or the cold tap to be on the right.

    <br />

    <!--SUB-SUB-HEAD-->
    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Stereotypes</strong></p>
    <p>
      A stereotype is an expectation about the characteristics, attributes, or
      behaviours of members of certain groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Social identity theory suggests that individuals need to map and define
      their identity in the context of group membership, and uphold the values
      of their group relative to others. Thus stereotypes are formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stereotypes tend to be more focused than categories such as: age, sex,
      race, religion, politics and occupation, and are based upon comparisons of
      average or typical characteristics in one group against another.

          Individual differences and situational factors can interact and prompt

        <p>
          Researchers that emphasise the significance of the individual

          One theory suggests that individuals are equipped with ‘risk

          of the thermostat. Regardless of workplace controls the individual
          will behave in a way that maintains the level of risk with which he

          Research has shown that there is truth in the old adage ‘familiarity

        <p>
          The way risk based data is presented (or framed) has been shown to
          introduce significant biases. Changing the description of a risk from
          positive to negative (i.e. talk about costs rather than benefits, or
          losses rather than gains) will have a measurable effect on observed
          behaviour.

        <p><strong>Perceptions of vulnerability</strong></p>
        <p>
          People with the perception of low vulnerability or invulnerability (to
          the consequences of smoking, drink driving, sexual activity etc.) are
          not likely to modify their behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people have an ‘unrealistic optimism’, and assume that the
          harmful consequences will happen to someone else. This makes them more
          willing to take risks in all areas of their lives, including the
          workplace. Young men, in particular, may be prone to feeling
          invulnerable.

        <p>
          Workplace studies have shown workers to perceive the risk associated
          with water based pesticides to be lower than solvent based, because
          water is natural and inert, and must therefore be lower risk than
          solvent. This is irrational as it does not consider the risk of the
          pesticide itself.
