        Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the
        mind, in clear and vivid form, of one of what seems several stimulus
        objects, or trains of thought.

      Without filtering mechanisms human beings would be overwhelmed with
      sensory information. The attention mechanisms enable valuable or
      interesting data to be processed whilst ignoring the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attention has been extensively researched. There are three areas of
      research particularly relevant to health and safety:

      Experiments into sustained attention, in the 1950s, explored how long an
      individual could perform a repetitive task while maintaining a level of
      focused attention. The accuracy of the participants work was seen to
      decrease over time, an effect termed ‘performance decrement’. The degree
      of performance decrement was reduced by the following intervention.

      Donald Broadbent worked with air traffic controllers during the second
      world war and researched how they were able to focus their attention
      (selectively attend). Broadbent’s research involved overloading them with
      stimuli so that they had too much information to process at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Broadbent’s main conclusion was that people can pay attention to only one
      channel at a time (single channel processing) and that the filter, which
      selects the channel, does it on the basis of the physical characteristics
      of the information coming in and did not consider the meaning of the
      message.
    </p>

      Later research (Cherry, 1953) identified the ‘cocktail party effect’ where
      particularly relevant information (such as a person’s name) was picked up
      by the research participants’ unoccupied ear, whilst actively listening to
      information with the other ear.

      Allport’s module resource theory proposed that a number of
      limited-capacity processing modules exist. The theory explains how it is
      easier to divide attention between dissimilar tasks (using different
      processing modules) than it is to divide attention between similar tasks.
      Similar tasks compete for resources from the same processing module
      resulting in interference and consequently a loss of attention.
