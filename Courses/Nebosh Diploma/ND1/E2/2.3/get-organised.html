    <p>
      The following factors about the business, the workplace and the workforce
      will impact on how best to engage with employees.
    </p>

      alt=""
      class="ast-img"
    />

    <p>
      These factors determine whether it is best to consult individuals or
      representatives, the methods to use, the organisation of inspections and
      investigations, and co-ordination between committees, among other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, a high-risk, unionised workplace with a large workforce
      spread over multiple sites may have union representatives from each site
      as a member of a site-based health and safety committee that meets
      regularly, and feeds into a corporate health and safety committee; whereas
      a non-unionised, smaller workplace, located on one small, low-risk site,
      is more likely to consult directly with employees on a day-to-day basis.
    </p>

    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>What should the workforce be consulted about?</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The workforce must be consulted about anything in the workplace that could
      substantially affect their health and safety. The specifics will vary from
      workplace to workplace.
    </p>
    <p>In general, employees must be consulted about:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          any change which may have a substantial effect on the workforceâ€™s
          health and safety. Such as introducing new or different procedures,
          types of work, equipment, premises, and ways of working (e.g. new
          shift patterns);
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          arrangements for getting competent people to help meet obligations
          under health and safety laws, for example the appointment of a health
          and safety manager
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          information on workplace risks and precautions they should take.
          Employees and representatives should be involved in determining the
          best way for information to be shared and issues of language, literacy
          and learning disabilities should be considered as appropriate
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the planning of health and safety training; and
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the health and safety consequences of introducing new technology.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Employees, or their representatives should also be consulted as a part of
      any workplace risk assessments. This is a valuable way of involving the
      staff that do the work as they know the risks involved and scope for
      potentially dangerous short cuts and problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employees are more likely to understand why procedures are put in place to
      control risks and follow them if they have been involved in the process of
      developing health and safety practices in their workplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formal consultation is not required before every task specific risk
      assessment conducted in the workplace, but consultation should form part
      of the general risk assessment process.

      Health and safety representatives must be equipped with appropriate skills
