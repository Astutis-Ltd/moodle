      <strong>What affects how to involve the workforce?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following factors about the business, the workplace and the workforce
      will impact on how best to engage with employees.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <img

        width="100%"
      /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      These factors determine whether it is best to consult individuals or
      representatives, the methods to use, the organisation of inspections and
      investigations, and co-ordination between committees, among other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, a high-risk, unionised workplace with a large workforce
      spread over multiple sites may have union representatives from each site
      as a member of a site-based health and safety committee that meets
      regularly, and feeds into a corporate health and safety committee; whereas
      a non-unionised, smaller workplace, located on one small, low-risk site,
      is more likely to consult directly with employees on a day-to-day basis.

    <p style="color: #3e3eff">
      <strong>What should the workforce be consulted about?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The workforce must be consulted about anything in the workplace that could
      substantially affect their health and safety. The specifics will vary from
      workplace to workplace.
    </p>
    <p>In general, employees must be consulted about:</p>

    <p>
      Employees, or their representatives should also be consulted as a part of
      any workplace risk assessments. This is a valuable way of involving the
      staff that do the work as they know the risks involved and scope for
      potentially dangerous short cuts and problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employees are more likely to understand why procedures are put in place to
      control risks and follow them if they have been involved in the process of
      developing health and safety practices in their workplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formal consultation is not required before every task specific risk
      assessment conducted in the workplace, but consultation should form part
      of the general risk assessment process.
