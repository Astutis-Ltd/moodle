    </p>
    <p>
      Accident rates are lower where employees genuinely feel they have a say in
      health and safety matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employee involvement in health and safety management relates to a more
      positive health and safety climate – 77% of employees felt encouraged to
      raise concerns in a good health and safety climate compared to 20% who
      felt encouraged to do so in a poor health and safety climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In poor health and safety climates, accident rates are highest among
      workplaces where employees do not feel they can have a say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stronger employee involvement means better control of common workplace
      risks such as slips and trips – very effective in 76% of cases where
      employees felt they were always consulted but only very effective in 40%
      of cases if they thought they were rarely, or never, consulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employers can learn about the risks through consultation – the risk of
      stress and slips and trips occur practically everywhere, but awareness of
      them is higher where there is employee involvement (62%) compared to where
      there is no involvement (28%).
    </p>
    <p>
      Research has also shown that workplaces with health and safety committees
      where some members are selected by unions have significantly lower rates
      of work-related injury than those found in workplaces with no co-operative
      health and safety management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Workplaces where employees are involved in taking decisions about health
      and safety are safer and healthier as employees influence health and
      safety through their own actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A workforce that feels valued and involved in decision-making plays a big
      part in a high-performing workplace. Empowering the workforce, giving them
      the right skills, and getting them involved in making decisions shows them
      that their health, safety and wellbeing is taken seriously. Workers are
      not only able to raise concerns but offer solutions too. There can be an
      impact far beyond health and safety management if the workforce is not
      engaged on health and safety issues which affect them.

    <p>
      When the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 came into force it was
      envisaged that the Trade Unions would facilitate the consultation process
      between employer and employees and the Safety Representatives and Safety
      Committees Regulations 1977 were introduced to this end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then the prominence of Trade Unions has diminished, and as a
      consequence many UK workers were left without the legal entitlement to be
      consulted on health and safety matters. The Health and Safety
      (Consultation with Employees) Regulations 1996 were introduced to address
      the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The legal requirements for consultation specify a minimum requirement.
      Building upon this legal foundation to create a genuine partnership
      between employers and employees creates a culture of collaboration where
      concerns, ideas and solutions are shared and acted upon, and where the
      whole workforce is engaged in the management of health and safety.
    </p>
    <p>HSE research has shown that stronger employee involvement means:</p>

    <p>
      Where employees are not represented under the Safety Representatives and
      Safety Committees Regulations 1977, the Health and Safety (Consultation
      with Employees) Regulations 1996 will apply. Employees may be consulted
      with directly as individuals, or through elected ‘Representatives of
      Employee Safety’ (RES), or a combination of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a small business consulting directly with individuals is often
      effective in giving everyone a chance to have a say in health and safety
      matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the size or spread of the workforce may make it unrealistic to
      consult everyone individually, arrangements can be made for employees to
      elect representatives of their choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      By law, trade union safety representatives have more functions than
      Representatives of Employee Safety (RES). However RES can be given extra
      roles as long as they agree to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are more than a few RES to consult, it is better to do so in a
      structured forum like a health and safety committee, or works council.

      Commitment from all sides is vital for employee involvement to be
