      This section is about how to make sure your arrangements for workforce
      involvement are effective as possible and covers how you can keep
      improving by:

    <p>
      After the consultation arrangements have been operational for a while and
      everyone is used to the processes in place, thoughts should turn to how to
      keep improving over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      For effective employee engagement, performance should be regularly
      monitored, and progress regularly reviewed with the workforce or their
      representatives. This helps drive continual improvement in the ways that
      everyone works together to enhance health and safety.

      To keep an eye on how involvement with the employees is working, the
      following checks can be made:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Check how supportive management are by asking employees and their
          representatives if they have been encouraged to get involved and been
          given time to participate
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Check that employees know who their representatives are and whether

        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Look into organisational arrangements for involving the workforce in
          health and safety and whether they have changed to allow employees
          greater opportunity to be involved in consultation. For example, have
          training arrangements improved, or do representatives have their roles
          noted on their performance appraisals?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Collect information on health and safety issues and ideas for
          addressing them that have been raised as a result of employee

          managed
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Think about other measures beyond health and safety because involving
          the workforce in health and safety could result in benefits in other

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          How will matters requiring further attention be addressed considering
          the employees views?

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Are there any lessons to learn and share?

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      As well as thinking about how well consultation with the workforce is
      going, checks should be made on progress and consideration given to
      opportunities for improvement. The review checklist can help to assess
      progress towards full employee involvement and joint problem solving.
    </p>
    <p>
      The statements are essentially goals to aim for, so that the arrangements
      for achieving those objectives can be reviewed. If the current
      arrangements are not helping, then more efforts can be made to improve
      involvement. NB Not everything on the list will apply to all
      organisations.

      If there are disagreements with employees or their representatives about

      Health and safety inspectors can only advise on health and safety matters.
      They cannot arbitrate in workplace disputes between an employer and
      employees.
