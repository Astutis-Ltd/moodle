    <p>
      Consultation is a two-way process involving an exchange of views between
      parties. Consultation in health and safety matters should involve open
      dialogue between the employer (or those representing management) and
      employees (or those representing the workers). Views, opinions and
      relevant information should be shared openly and in a timely manner.
      Consultation should occur prior to any decision being made by the
      employer.

    <p>HSG263 advises employers that consultation involves:</p>
