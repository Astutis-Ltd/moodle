    <p>
      The behavioural aspects of consultation may be considered at the
      individual or group level.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Tokenism</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      If the leadership team or individual corporate leader does not see the
      value in true consultation with the workforce and the benefits of
      workforce engagement there is a danger that efforts to consult will not be
      made seriously and only a token gesture will be made. Tokenism is about
      making half-hearted gestures perhaps for appearances sake rather than
      because of any real enthusiasm to act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research into employee (or other stakeholder) engagement recognises a
      spectrum of efforts from tokenism at the bottom end through legally
      compliant arrangements for formal consultation (perhaps with little
      enthusiasm to achieve anything other than compliance) through to concerted
      efforts to encourage workforce participation, involvement and engagement.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Peer group pressure</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Peer group pressure arises where a group has established its values and
      normed its behaviours and will not tolerate group members expressing
      incompatible opinions or behaving differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formal and informal discussions with groups of workers such as safety
      committees, safety circles, departmental meetings etc may be affected if
      there is a reluctance to express different opinions.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Conflict</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      As discussed earlier conflicts arise where two individuals or groups (e.g.
      ‘management’ and ‘workers’) have incompatible concerns. Collaborative
      efforts between committed managers and engaged workers should ensure that
      concerns are shared and that practical effective solutions are found.

        The role of the health and safety practitioner in the consultative
        process
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The safety practitioner as ‘competent person’ should play a significant
      part in consultation processes, for example:
