      The distinction between managers and leaders has been much debated over
      many decades. Nowadays it is generally accepted that the concepts although
      distinct are not mutually exclusive.
    </p>
    <p>The role of the manager is to:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          carry out traditional defined management functions such as planning,
          budgeting and recruiting
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          fulfil the requirements of a prescribed role such as figurehead,
          negotiator etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Leadership, on the other hand, is about more than fulfilling a role within
      a system. It is about:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">challenging the status quo</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          providing a vision, direction and strategy
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          communicating to motivate and inspire others to do their bit.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Therefore it is possible for people not in management roles to be leaders
      (distributed leadership), and it is possible for people in senior
      management roles to be:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">good leaders / good managers</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">good leaders / bad managers</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">bad leaders / good managers</li>

    <p>
      Warren Bennis summarised the distinction succinctly as:
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >‘managers are people who do things right and leaders are people who do
        the right things’.</span
      >
    </p>

      <h5>Historical perspectives on leadership</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      In the early twentieth century much of the research into leadership would
      be generally classified as trait theory trying to identify specific
      physical and/or psychological characteristics (traits, attributes or
      competencies) that distinguish leaders from followers. This included
      research into ‘great men’ and charismatic leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the 1940s onwards the focus shifted from traits or characteristics to
      behaviours. Behavioural theory approaches to leadership sought to identify
      the types of behaviours that are most and least effective in the context
      of organisational performance. Lewin, Lippitt and White identified three
      basic leadership styles: authoritarian, democratic and laissez faire,
      based on what leaders do and how they behave, and concluded that
      democratic leadership approaches were generally best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later research in the 1980s by French et al and by Smith and Peterson
      showed that while this was generally the case, for productivity a present
      autocratic or authoritarian leader had the best results.

      By the 1960s <span class="ast-bold">contingency theories</span> of
      leadership came to the fore, recognising that the effectiveness of
      particular leadership behaviours or styles is contingent upon the demands
      of the situation such as historical, economic or political context.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most recent wave of research (1980s onwards) has largely focussed on
      <span class="ast-bold">transformational leadership</span> (including
      charismatic leadership and ‘new’ leadership) which is about a leader’s
      ability to energise and motivate others to perform beyond their original
      expectations.
