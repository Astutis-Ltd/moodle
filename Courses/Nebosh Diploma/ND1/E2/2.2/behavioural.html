      Ed Schein noted that
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >‘the unique and essential function of leadership is the manipulation of
        culture’.</span
      >
      The IOGP (International Association of Oil and Gas Producers) considered
      that
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >‘Safety Culture starts with leadership; leadership drives culture,
        which in turn drives behaviour.’</span

      Lord Cullen’s report into the Ladbroke Grove (Paddington) train crash

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">
        The commitment to safety of senior executives is not visible at the
        working and operational level and the safety policy lacks credibility in
        the eyes of the employees.
      </p>
      <p>
        ...conviction needs to come from the top, needs to be broadcast from the
        top, needs to be continually refreshed from the top and the top needs to
        be seen, visibly seen as active in its representation of its value...
