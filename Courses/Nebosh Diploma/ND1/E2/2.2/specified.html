      The NEBOSH Diploma Syllabus requires consideration of the following
      leadership theories and their likely impact upon health and safety
      performance:

      <p>Transactional leadership</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Transactional leadership considers leadership to be ‘a process of
      exchange’ that relies on good contractual relationships, i.e. offer and
      acceptance and the exchange of items of value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaders transact with followers to get things done by creating expectation
      and setting objectives and providing recognition and reward for successful
      task completion (and punishments for non-completion).
    </p>
    <p>
      Many would consider these transactional processes to be management rather
      than leadership. Transactional skills are necessary for getting things
      done but are done within the context of a management framework. True
      leadership skills are essential to effect cultural change and improve
      safety performance.

      <p>Authentic leadership</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The roots of authentic leadership are based on ancient Greek philosophy
      ‘know thyself’. More than 2 400 years after Socrates emphasised the
      importance of self-awareness, leadership researchers are still
      investigating the importance of self-awareness, self-regulation and
      authenticity as critical aspects of leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill George (2007) is often credited with popularising authentic
      leadership in management studies and general culture. George believes that
      the only valid test of a leader is his or her ability to bring people
      together to achieve sustainable results over time and that real leadership
      requires years of development and hard work.
    </p>
    <p>
      George holds that authentic leaders usually demonstrate the following five
      traits:

    </div>
    <!--List Numbered End-->

    <p>
      To discover their purpose, authentic leaders must understand themselves
      and the passions that drive them. The values of authentic leaders are
      shaped by their personal beliefs and developed through introspection,
      consultation with others, and years of experience. An authentic leader
      lives their values even under extreme pressure, consequently trust is
      built and maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      George offers Warren Buffet as an example of an authentic leader and
      someone who has exercised consistently high levels of self-discipline, in
      a career of over 40 years, becoming the most successful investor in
      businesses in the USA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banks et al’s review of authentic leadership literature in 2016 offered
      Walumbwa’s (2008) definition as the most generally accepted definition of
      authentic leadership:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        “a pattern of leader behaviour that draws upon and promotes both
        positive psychological capacities and a positive ethical climate, to
        foster greater self-awareness, an internalized moral perspective,
        balanced processing of information, and relational transparency on the
        part of leaders working with followers, fostering positive
        self-development.”
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      The following were offered as the major characteristics of authentic

      Walumbwa et al (2008) also developed an ‘authentic leadership validation

      <p>Resonant leadership</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Resonance, in this context, is the property of being ‘in tune’. The
      concept of resonant leadership was introduced in the book ‘Primal
      Leadership’ by Goleman, Boyatzis and McKee (2001) and tied in with
      Goleman’s earlier work on unleashing emotional intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boyatzis and McKee developed the concept with two sequel books ‘Resonant
      Leadership’ in 2005 and ‘Becoming a Resonant Leader’ in 2008.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resonant leaders work at developing their emotional intelligence
      competencies of self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and
      relationship management. Boyatzis and McKee noted that even good leaders
      find it very difficult to sustain their effectiveness, and resonance, over
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best leaders give of themselves constantly and when they sacrifice too
      much for too long, they can become trapped in the “sacrifice syndrome.”
      Leadership is stressful as power and influence creates distance between
      leaders and other people, potentially leaving leaders lonely and isolated
      from supportive relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stress associate with leadership is termed ‘power stress’ and is
      difficult to deal with over time as leaders eventually become exhausted
      and burn up or burn out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exhausted leaders suffer physically and emotionally, and their cognitive
      functioning is impaired. Resonance is then replaced by dissonance and
      because emotions are contagious, dissonance spreads quickly to those
      around the leader and eventually permeates the organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than constantly sacrificing themselves to workplace demands,
      leaders can use specific techniques to combat stress, avoid burnout, and
      renew themselves physically, mentally, and emotionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three paths of mindfulness, hope and compassion are advocated for creating
      resonance and for restoring and renewing the leader. Mindfulness hope and
      compassion are held to spark physiological changes that help to reverse
      the negative effects of power stress. By mindfully attending to oneself
      and others, encouraging an optimistic vision of the future, and caring for
      others, leaders can ignite or reignite resonance in themselves and those
      around them.
