      Investigations into major disasters such as Chernobyl, Piper Alpha, and
      Clapham Junction, highlighted that sophisticated engineering and technical
      safeguards can fail because people fail to do what they are supposed to
      do, and that these failures are not only attributable to individual
      errors, but to malpractices that corrupt the social systems that makes
      organisations function (i.e. are attributable to poor safety culture).

      The HSE has expressed concerns about companies that talk about ‘safety
      culture’ in a very narrow way, usually when referring to the inclination
      of employees to comply with rules or act safely. Broader issues of
      organisational culture and style of management can be even more
      significant, for example, where management has a natural, unconscious bias
      for production over safety, or a tendency to focus on the short term, or
      can be highly reactive.

      <em>Note:</em> The antithesis of the above is also true, i.e. the absence

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Sub-cultures</strong></p>
    <p>
      A number of studies have found the presence of subcultures within an
      organisation. Sub-cultures are likely to develop where groups of employees
      experience different working conditions or are exposed to different
      management styles. In the general management literature, the lack of
      cultural cohesion can be seen as an impediment to effective organisational
      performance. However this is not the case with health and safety. Work
      groups are likely to view risk differently depending on the type of work
      they do (for example, shop-floor production workers compared to office
      based colleagues). An appreciation of sub-cultures can lead to useful
      contextual insight into the different risk and hazards experienced by
      workgroups.
    </p>
    <br />

    <!--SUB-SUB-HEAD-->
    <p style="color: #3e3eff">
      <strong>Safety culture and safety performance</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Safety culture is consistently and independently associated with safety
      performance, i.e. an organisation with a positive safety culture shows
      good safety performance (and an organisation with a negative safety
      culture shows poor safety performance) irrespective of other variables
      such as organisation size or risk profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employee perceptions of and attitudes towards safety have also been shown
      to be consistently and independently associated with individual health and
      wellbeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evidence that these associations are not limited to particular sectors
      of industry suggests that they are robust and generally applicable. The
      findings also suggest that measuring safety perceptions at an individual
      level makes a significant contribution to understanding the profile of
      factors associated with employee health and safety.
