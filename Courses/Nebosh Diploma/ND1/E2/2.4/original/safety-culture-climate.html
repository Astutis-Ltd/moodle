    <p>
      The term ‘safety culture’ has been widely used since the International
      Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report into the Chernobyl nuclear accident
      (1986). The term ‘safety climate’ has been used over a similar period, and
      both terms have often been used interchangeably to describe employees’
      attitudes to safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, safety climate is regarded as more superficial and transient
      than safety culture, and as an indicator or ‘snapshot’ of an
      organisation’s overall safety culture. There are still no universally
      accepted definitions of either term.
    </p>
    <p>
      HSE commissioned research based upon the work done by Cooper suggests that
      a useful distinction between the concepts is to use safety culture to
      refer to the behavioural aspects (i.e. what people do), and the
      situational aspects of the company (i.e. what the organisation has), and
      ‘safety climate’ to refer to the psychological characteristics of
      employees (i.e. how people feel).
    </p>
    <p>
      From this model, as shown in the below figure, the measures of an
      organisations culture can be seen to be objective (based on observations
      of what is happening and what is in place) whereas the measurement of
      climate is subjective (based on the workers perception of how seriously
      safety is taken within the organisation).
