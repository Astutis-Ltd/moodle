      Investigations into major disasters such as Chernobyl, Piper Alpha, and
      Clapham Junction, highlighted that sophisticated engineering and technical
      safeguards can fail because people fail to do what they are supposed to
      do, and that these failures are not only attributable to individual
      errors, but to malpractices that corrupt the social systems that makes
      organisations function (i.e. are attributable to poor safety culture).

        …the mix of shared values, attitudes and patterns of behaviour that give

      The HSE has expressed concerns about companies that talk about ‘safety
      culture’ in a very narrow way, usually when referring to the inclination
      of employees to comply with rules or act safely. Broader issues of
      organisational culture and style of management can be even more
      significant, for example, where management has a natural, unconscious bias
      for production over safety, or a tendency to focus on the short term, or
      can be highly reactive.
    </p>
    <p>The HSE has a definition for safety culture.</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">
        The safety culture of an organisation is the produce of individual and
        group values, attitudes, perceptions, competencies, and patterns of
        behaviour that determine the commitment to, and the style and
        proficiency of, an organisation’s health and safety management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organisations with a positive safety culture are characterised by
        communications founded on mutual trust, by shared perceptions of the
        importance of safety and by confidence in the efficacy of preventive
        measures.

      Every group of people develops a ‘culture’. In an organisation with a good
      safety culture everyone puts health and safety high on the list and adopts
      the same positive attitudes to health and safety. This influences the ways
      in which individuals in the group handle new events and decisions.

          also ineffective. Blame should be attributed when it is deserved (for
          example, gross negligence / misconduct / extreme violations). People
          should be held accountable for their actions. Accountability is about
          trust and respect. Blaming is about judgement and discrediting the

    <p>
      A number of studies have found the presence of subcultures within an
      organisation. Sub-cultures are likely to develop where groups of employees
      experience different working conditions or are exposed to different
      management styles. In the general management literature, the lack of
      cultural cohesion can be seen as an impediment to effective organisational
      performance. However this is not the case with health and safety. Work
      groups are likely to view risk differently depending on the type of work
      they do (for example, shop-floor production workers compared to office
      based colleagues). An appreciation of sub-cultures can lead to useful
      contextual insight into the different risk and hazards experienced by
      workgroups.

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Safety culture and safety performance</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Safety culture is consistently and independently associated with safety
      performance, i.e. an organisation with a positive safety culture shows
      good safety performance (and an organisation with a negative safety
      culture shows poor safety performance) irrespective of other variables
      such as organisation size or risk profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employee perceptions of and attitudes towards safety have also been shown
      to be consistently and independently associated with individual health and
      wellbeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evidence that these associations are not limited to particular sectors
      of industry suggests that they are robust and generally applicable. The
      findings also suggest that measuring safety perceptions at an individual
      level makes a significant contribution to understanding the profile of
      factors associated with employee health and safety.
