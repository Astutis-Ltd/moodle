    <p>
      Due to the recognised links between a ‘good’ safety culture and good
      safety performance, many organisations have attempted to measure or assess
      their existing safety culture, and thus identify strengths and areas for
      improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research in the oil and gas industry revealed that different sites within
      the same organisation may differ in the maturity of their safety culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safety improvement techniques can fail if not matched to the maturity
      level of the existing safety culture. As safety culture matures, further
      improvement does not necessarily involve ‘more of the same’ – different
      improvement methods are required as the safety culture matures.
    </p>
    <p>
      A joint HSE / oil industry-funded project to address some of these
      concerns led to the development of the Safety Culture Maturity Model
      (SCMM) based upon the safety culture features listed in the HSE’s human
      factors guidance document Reducing error and influencing behaviour
      (HSG48).
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the SCMM, the safety culture maturity of an organisation
      consists of ten elements:
    </p>

    <p>
      It is likely that an organisation will be at different levels on the ten
      components of the SCMM. The ‘average’ level is used as an overall
      indicator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SCMM is set out in a number of iterative stages which organisations
      progress through sequentially, building on the strengths and removing the
      weaknesses of the previous level.

    <p>
      If the safety climate is an indicator or snapshot of the organisation’s
      safety culture a means of measurement is required. (If culture is
      temperature – climate is a thermometer reading).
    </p>
    <p>
      A range of tools (examples in the below table) have been developed for
      measuring different aspects of climate or culture, many of which were
      supported by the HSE and developed with specific industry support.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with general health and safety auditing, information can be gathered in
      three main ways:

    <p>
      A combination of approaches has been shown to improve the overall
      effectiveness of measurement of organisational climate or culture. A more
      holistic view through triangulation of objective organisational
      attributes, individual perceptions of the organisation, and of risks and
      controls is advocated by the Loughborough University Safety Climate
      Assessment Toolkit (SCAT).

    <p>
      Many of the commercially available tools rely on attitude survey
      questionnaires to gather data. The table below gives more detail.

    <p>
      An attitude is a mental state that affects an individuals’ response to a
      particular object or situation, influencing how he or she deals with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      An attitude survey or questionnaire can be used to gather information from
      individuals regarding their views on, and feelings about, safety where
      they work, including views on levels of management commitment to safety,
      problems with safety communication etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      People’s attitudes will affect, to some degree, how they behave at work so
      gauging attitudes to safety can be an important indicator of an
      organisation’s safety climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Survey results will also give an indication of the degree to which certain
      views and beliefs are shared among the workforce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically a Likert scale is used to gauge attitude along a scale. The
      below figure shows a five point scale ranging from ‘strongly agree’ to
      ‘strongly disagree’.
