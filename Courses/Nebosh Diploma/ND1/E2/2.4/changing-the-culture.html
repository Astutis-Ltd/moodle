    <p>
      As discussed earlier the unique and essential function of leadership is to
      manipulate culture. In an organisation with a poor safety culture and poor
      safety performance, transformational leadership is essential to challenge
      currently unacceptable mind-sets and behaviours and to sell the vision of
      a better future state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the process for effecting cultural change is no different to that of
      any other transformational change management programme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kurt Lewin, a physicist and social scientist first presented his model of
      organisational change in 1947. Using the analogy of changing the shape of
      a block of ice Lewin described a journey with a beginning, middle and end.
      Lewin’s ‘Unfreeze, Change, Freeze (or Refreeze)’ model is still relevant
      and used today, although it has been criticised for being too simplistic.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Stage 1: Unfreezing</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      This first stage is about getting ready to change and involves preparing
      people for change and ideally creating a situation in which they want the
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong leadership is essential in developing the vision of the future
      state, convincing employees of the need for change, and inspiring and
      motivating them to work together to achieve the new objectives. Employee
      engagement at all levels is also essential for success and consultation,
      provision of information and training can all help in this regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfreezing and getting motivated for the change is all about weighing up
      the ‘pros’ and ‘cons’ of the proposed change and ensuring that the ‘pro’s’
      outnumber the ‘con’s’ before taking any action.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Stage 2: Change or transition</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Change is a transitional process. People need time to learn about and
      understand the changes. Support through training, coaching and effective
      communication is an essential part of the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attempting to impose a change without consultation or to try and effect a
      change too quickly can be counter- productive leading to worker resistance
      and antipathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A clearly mapped process with achievable ‘stepping stones’ along the way
      can help maintain enthusiasm by presenting opportunities to share
      successes long the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trial and error mistakes will inevitably be made as part of the process
      and should be treated as opportunities to refine the transitional
      processes whilst keeping an eye on the objectives. Feedback should be
      provided on successes, failures and lessons learned as a matter of course.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Stage 3: Freezing (or refreezing)</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Freezing or refreezing is about establishing stability once the changes
      have been made, and as the changes are accepted and become the new norm.
      It takes time for people to form new relationships and become comfortable
      with the new routines. The benefits of the change should be regularly
      reinforced going forwards to ensure it is accepted and maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of freezing is not compatible with modern thinking about change
      being a continuous and flexible process and in the current age of
      ‘accelerated change’ time for bedding in is an unlikely luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern models of change, such as the ADKAR model (Hiatt, 2003) in the
      below figure, are more explicit about the need for on-going reinforcement.

      <span class="ast-bold">Awareness</span> of the need for change
      <br />Planned communications to ensure employees fully understand why
      change is necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Desire</span> to participate in and support the
      change <br />Employees are able to make informed personal decisions to
      support, and participate in the change. Building desire can be partly
      achieved through incentives (needs or rewards).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Knowledge</span> on how to change <br />Two types
      of knowledge need to be addressed: knowledge on how to change (what to do
      during the transition) and knowledge on how to perform after the change.
      Knowledge can be provided through training and education, coaching, forums
      and mentoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Ability</span> to implement required skills and
      behaviours <br />Ability is the difference between theory and practice.
      Practical performance needs to be supported through practice, coaching and
      feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Reinforcement</span> to sustain the change
      <br />Appropriate behaviours are reinforced through positive feedback,
      rewards, recognition, performance measurement and corrective action.

      The absence of any of the ‘building blocks’ discussed above may compromise
      the success of the cultural change initiative.

    <p>
      Resistance to change may be driven by any number of practical or cultural
      variables, for example:
