    <p>
      A PESTLE analysis is a technique that is often used by marketing and HR
      professionals to audit the factors that can influence an organisation’s
      operating environment with the aim of developing appropriate responses to
      changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all of the factors can be directly affected by the organisation but an
      understanding of the operating environments is essential if
      <span class="ast-bold">opportunities</span>
      are to be maximised and threats minimised (SWOT).
    </p>
    <p>
      The six elements of a PESTLE analysis form a framework for reviewing an
      organisations strategy, position, direction, marketing proposition,
      business idea etc.

      The NEBOSH Diploma syllabus requires consideration of specific internal
      and external influences as shown below.

    <p class="ast-bold">Finance</p>
    <p>
      Organisations are motivated in much the same way as individuals. When
      times are hard the primary motivation is the need to survive and higher
      needs will tend to be disregarded. In such times organisations may well
      look to save money from training and maintenance budgets and other areas
      that may be perceived as less critical in the short term.
    </p>
    <p class="ast-bold">Production and organisational goals</p>
    <p>
      The primary objective of an organisation is survival, and thereafter to
      turn a healthy profit. The position that ‘health and safety is our No 1
      priority’ is not a universal truth. It might be hoped that when people’s
      lives are at risk it will be seen to be so but, in general, organisational
      efforts will be focussed on the organisations ‘raison d’etre’ – be it
      manufacturing a product or delivering a service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time pressure to meet production demands has been shown to increase
      accident rates, and productivity bonuses have also been shown to
      compromise safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding the appropriate balance between health and safety and production
      is critical in developing a positive safety culture.
    </p>
    <p class="ast-bold">Trade unions</p>
    <p>
      HSE research has shown that good working relationships between management
      and staff lead to:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          better control of common workplace risks
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">lower accident rates</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          a more positive health and safety climate where employees feel
          encouraged to raise concerns.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Historically the Trade Unions have been prime movers in building such
      relationships through arrangements for formal consultation
      <span class="ast-bold">(Element 2.3).</span>
      An effective safety committee with a co-operative relationship between
      management and the trade unions is a good indicator of a positive health
      and safety culture.

    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p class="ast-bold">Legislation</p>
    <p>
      Health and safety legislation establishes a minimum standard of acceptable
      behaviour in the workplace with the aim of protecting employees from less
      scrupulous employers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Health and Safety at Work Act and supporting regulations provide a
      framework for managing health and safety to that minimal acceptable
      standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Non-compliance with legislation is liable to result in enforcement action
      which could result in the imposition of fines or prison sentences. This
      may be seen to have a deterrent effect.
    </p>
    <p class="ast-bold">Parliament/HSE</p>
    <p>
      The government of the day will have a philosophical perspective on the
      appropriate level of regulation / deregulation of health and safety. The
      government will also set the strategic direction of the Health and Safety
      Executive (HSE).
    </p>
    <p class="ast-bold">Enforcement agencies</p>
    <p>
      Enforcement of health and safety legislation is split between the HSE,
      Local Authorities and the Office of Rail Regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to law enforcement the enforcement agencies are committed to
      supporting government strategies and increasingly look to work in
      partnership with business.
    </p>
    <p class="ast-bold">Courts and tribunals</p>
    <p>
      Courts and tribunals interpret legislation and set legal precedents which
      influence health and safety practice. Sentencing practice may also
      influence the level of priority that organisations give to the management
      of health and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The role of courts and tribunals was discussed in
      <span class="ast-bold">Element 1.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="ast-bold">Contracts</p>
    <p>
      There is an implied term in the ‘contract of employment’ that the employer
      will exercise reasonable care for the employee’s physical and
      psychological wellbeing. A failure to address genuine concerns could
      amount to a fundamental breach of contract. With a ‘contract for
      employment’ (client / contractor relationship) there will be terms
      requiring each party to take reasonable care of the health and safety of
      the other party.
    </p>
    <p class="ast-bold">Client/contractor relationships</p>
    <p>
      Supply chain pressures have a major impact upon the management of health
      and safety. High quality organisations will require partners to perform to
      similarly high standards and will not use organisations that do not work
      to those standards. The management of contractors in supply chains is
      discussed more fully in <span class="ast-bold">Element 9.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Good contractors can also exert pressure by informing the client of
      concerns and shortcomings to positively influence behaviour.
    </p>
    <p class="ast-bold">Trade unions</p>
    <p>
      As well as influencing organisations on a local level Trade Unions
      function as pressure groups, lobbying government regarding the health,
      safety and welfare of their members. They also fund research and provide
      training at various levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trade Unions have also had a major impact through their involvement in
      civil legal class actions and key individual cases in support of their
      members.
    </p>
    <p class="ast-bold">Insurance companies</p>
    <p>
      More than 850 000 people are injured or made ill as a result of their job
      each year and around 60 000 of these successfully obtain compensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1999 the Association of British Insurers (ABI) reported that the cost
      of claims was 54% higher than the monies received from insurance premiums.
      The cost of employers’ liability insurance has continued to rise to
      redress the balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many insurers are now taking an active interest in risk management,
      especially regarding the control of long term health hazards. Insurance
      companies can influence organisational behaviour through the provision of
      training and consultancy support services and also by setting conditions
      for employers’ liability insurance.
    </p>
    <p class="ast-bold">Public opinion</p>
    <p>
      The public provides the organisations workforce and customer base. A major
      accident may have a negative impact on public opinion and perception –
      either directly or via the media.
    </p>
    <p>
      Socially responsible organisations can positively influence public
      perception through marketing themselves based on a strong ethical
      standpoint.
