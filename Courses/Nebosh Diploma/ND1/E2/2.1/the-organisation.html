    <p>
      A <span class="ast-bold">system</span> is a group of interacting,
      interrelated, or interdependent elements arranged in an orderly manner to
      form a coherent whole. Systems may involve the movement of matter, energy,
      or information through defined pathways.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Systems theory</span> relates to the study of
      self-regulating systems (i.e. those that self-correct their behaviour
      through feedback). Self-regulating systems are found in many areas of
      nature and science, for example, biology, sociology, meteorology,
      engineering and IT, as well as organisational theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The below figure presents an organisation as an open system in an
      interactive relationship with the environment â€“ drawing resources from it,
      and converting them into goods or services, which are returned to it. The
      feedback loop provides information on performance which can be used to
      refine processes and improve future performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each department or division within an organisational system may be
      considered as a sub-system with its own inputs, transformation processes
      and outputs, and its own environmental contexts.
