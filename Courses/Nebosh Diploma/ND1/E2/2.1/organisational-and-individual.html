    <p>
      The organisation’s goals will be established by the strategic apex (for
      example, the board of directors) of the organisation. These goals can only
      be achieved if the groups and individuals within the organisation share
      them and work collectively towards achieving them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The integration of personal goals with the overall objectives of the
      organisation is the role of the management, and it is achieved through the
      co-operation of employees and / or the management control of employee
      efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional factors include effective communication channels, and systems
      for ensuring the competence of key personnel.

      <p>Co-operation</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Co-operation is the process of working together to achieve shared goals.
      To be effective the process should deliver positive outcomes for all
      participants.
    </p>
    <p>
      With specific regard to health and safety management, encouraging employee
      participation in risk control brings a pool of knowledge and experience to
      the process to the benefit of the organisation as a whole, and the people
      working in it. Health and safety effectively becomes ‘everybody’s
      business’ and the safety culture
      <span class="ast-bold">(Element 2.4)</span> improves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Successful organisations often go further than strictly required by law
      and actively encourage and support consultation in different ways.
      (Consultation arrangements are discussed further in
      <span class="ast-bold">Element 2.3).</span>

    <p>
      Management control is about motivating employees to perform effectively in
      pursuit of the organisation’s goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Management control systems are essentially continual improvement cycles
      constructed around the essential elements of planning, doing, checking and
      acting (PDCA).
    </p>
    <p>
      Control mechanisms utilise a combination of
      <span class="ast-bold">behavioural controls</span> (controlling employees
      behaviour), and <span class="ast-bold">output controls</span> (controlling
      performance through measurement of outputs / results).

    <p>
      Performance management is the systematic process for improving
      organisational performance by developing the performance of individuals
      and teams through understanding and managing performance within an agreed
      framework of planned goals, standards and competence requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Performance standards are the basis of planning and measuring employees’
      performance and are essential if policies are to be translated from good
      intentions into a series of coordinated actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good performance standards link responsibilities to specific outputs and
      can be used to specify how individuals will be held accountable for their
      health and safety responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>They should specify:</p>

      Effective risk management controls are required at each stage of the
      business process:

    <p>
      An effective health and safety management system is needed to manage the
      layers of controls and to provide a framework for ensuring the adequacy of
      the level of control at any given time.

      <p>Competence</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Competence is the ability to perform adequately in a given role. The
      <span class="ast-bold"
        >Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 (Regulation
        7)</span

      state that:

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        A person shall be regarded as competent . . . where he has sufficient

      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      The competence of key personnel is vital to the success of the
      organisation and must be secured for operational staff, all tiers of
      management, and specialist support.

      <p>Communication</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Effective communication is about more than the availability of
      communication channels or media, it is about getting the right message to
      the right people at the right time. In the context of safety management,
      effective procedures are required for managing internal and external
      communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Internal communication</span> channels are required
      between the various levels and functions of the organisation, and
      different businesses or sites in a large organisation (top down / bottom
      up  / cross functional / centre to periphery and back).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">External communication</span> systems should be in
      place to address receiving and responding to relevant communications from
      external parties (for example, stakeholders or enforcement agencies).
