      <h2 style="padding-top: 24px">Organisational and individual goals</h2>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      The organisation’s goals will be established by the strategic apex (for
      example, the board of directors) of the organisation. These goals can only
      be achieved if the groups and individuals within the organisation share
      them and work collectively towards achieving them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The integration of personal goals with the overall objectives of the
      organisation is the role of the management, and it is achieved through the
      co-operation of employees and / or the management control of employee
      efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional factors include effective communication channels, and systems
      for ensuring the competence of key personnel.
    </p>
    <br />

    <!--SUB-SUB-HEAD-->
    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Co-operation</strong></p>
    <p>
      Co-operation is the process of working together to achieve shared goals.
      To be effective the process should deliver positive outcomes for all
      participants.
    </p>
    <p>
      With specific regard to health and safety management, encouraging employee
      participation in risk control brings a pool of knowledge and experience to
      the process to the benefit of the organisation as a whole, and the people
      working in it. Health and safety effectively becomes ‘everybody’s
      business’ and the safety culture <strong>(Element 2.4)</strong> improves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Successful organisations often go further than strictly required by law
      and actively encourage and support consultation in different ways.
      (Consultation arrangements are discussed further in
      <strong>Element 2.3</strong>).
    </p>
    <br />

    <!--SUB-SUB-HEAD-->
    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Control</strong></p>
    <p>
      Management control is about motivating employees to perform effectively in
      pursuit of the organisation’s goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Management control systems are essentially continual improvement cycles
      constructed around the essential elements of planning, doing, checking and
      acting (PDCA).
    </p>
    <p>
      Control mechanisms utilise a combination of
      <strong>behavioural controls</strong> (controlling employees behaviour),
      and <strong>output controls</strong> (controlling performance through
      measurement of outputs / results).
    </p>
    <br />

    <!--SUB-SUB-HEAD-->
    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Control of people</strong></p>
    <p>
      Performance management is the systematic process for improving
      organisational performance by developing the performance of individuals
      and teams through understanding and managing performance within an agreed
      framework of planned goals, standards and competence requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Performance standards are the basis of planning and measuring employees’
      performance and are essential if policies are to be translated from good
      intentions into a series of coordinated actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good performance standards link responsibilities to specific outputs and
      can be used to specify how individuals will be held accountable for their
      health and safety responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>They should specify:</p>

      The competence of key personnel is vital to the success of the

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Communication</strong></p>
    <p>
      Effective communication is about more than the availability of
      communication channels or media, it is about getting the right message to
      the right people at the right time. In the context of safety management,
      effective procedures are required for managing internal and external
      communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Internal communication</strong> channels are required between the
      various levels and functions of the organisation, and different businesses
      or sites in a large organisation (top down / bottom up  / cross
      functional / centre to periphery and back).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>External communication</strong> systems should be in place to
      address receiving and responding to relevant communications from external
      parties (for example, stakeholders or enforcement agencies).
