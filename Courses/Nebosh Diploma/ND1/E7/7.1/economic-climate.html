    <p>
      HSE sponsored research into the effects of economic downturn on health and
      safety performance has been conducted during the most recent, and
      previous, recessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key findings of the HSE and other research are that accident injury
      rates fall during periods of reduced economic activity.
    </p>
    <p>Reasons for this include:</p>

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          an increase in average levels of experience (fewer new recruits /
          fewer young males) leads to a decrease in average risks of injury;
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          reduced ‘work effort’ as a consequence of falling levels of demand
          leads to a reduction in average working hours, lower levels of fatigue
          and a corresponding drop in average risks of injury; and
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          reduced incentives for workers to report minor injuries.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      There is also some conflicting evidence that ‘corner cutting’ by employers
      can lead to increasing rates of injury, as a consequence of reduced
      investment and training, and/or the weaker bargaining position of workers
      due to higher unemployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overall effect though is one of a reduction in accident injury rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 1989-1993 UK recession the rate of reported major injuries fell by
      > 10%, and the numbers of injuries fell even further, because of the drop
      in employment levels. The effects were most pronounced in the construction
      and manufacturing sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is much less evidence available regarding the effect of economic
      downturn on occupational ill-health, largely because of the latency period
      between exposure and illness in many cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most recent recession affected different groups of workers to
      different extents. Unemployment rates for males and young workers
      increased significantly more than average levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regional effects were also noticeable with higher increases in levels of
      unemployment prevalent in traditional industrial areas such as Wales, the
      west midlands, and the north-west.
    </p>
    <p>
      Available evidence on the impact of economic recovery suggests that upward
      pressure on injury rates is to be expected due to increases in new hires
      and working hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more rapid the recovery, the more marked it is likely to be especially
      in sectors where hiring is concentrated among workers with little previous
      experience.
