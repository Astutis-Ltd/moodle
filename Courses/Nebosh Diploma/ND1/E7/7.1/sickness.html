      HM Governments Departments of Work and Pensions (DWP) and Health (DoH)
      (2017) estimated that ill-health that prevents people from working costs
      the UK economy around £100 billion a year. To address this and develop a
      strong and sustainable economic plan it is imperative that the skills,
      talents, and contribution of every person of working age are harnessed as
      effectively as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good employment has also been shown to keep people mentally and physically
      healthy and reduce health inequalities; provide economic independence; and
      give choices and opportunities to fulfil broader ambitions in life. It
      should be noted however that being employed in some jobs may still have a
      worse impact on health than having no job at all, e.g. poor quality, low
      paid and insecure employment, such as temporary casual work and
      unregulated work, may be as, or more, detrimental to health than
      unemployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sickness absence rates vary by gender, age, occupation, sector, region and
      the size of the workplace. Individuals who are out of work for long
      periods of time due to sickness experience a drop in incomes which can
      result in poverty and social exclusion and, the longer someone is not
      working the less likely they are to return to work - someone who has been
      off sick for 6 months or longer has an 80% chance of being off work for 5
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) was introduced as the benefit for
      people with a health condition or disability in 2008 and provides income
      replacement for those who are unable to work because of illness or
      disability. It is based on a functional assessment of capability for work.
      In 2020 1 976 000 claimed Employment and Support Allowance (NB because of
      the transition to Universal Credit it is not possible to get a direct
      comparison with levels of Incapacity Benefit pre-2008).
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common causes of long-term sickness absence for manual and
      non-manual workers in the UK over recent years are shown below:

      NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) published
      Guideline PH19 “Workplace health: long-term sickness absence and
      incapacity to work” in 2009 and replaced it NICE Guideline 146 (Same
      title) in 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guideline covers how to help people return to work after long-term
      sickness absence, reduce recurring sickness absence, and help prevent
      people moving from short-term to long-term sickness absence.

      There are over 6.9 million disabled people of working age in the UK which
      is just under 1/5th of the working age population.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite recent progress, disabled people still face significant
      disadvantages. Only 50% of disabled people of working age have a job,
      compared to 80% in the population as a whole. Disabled people are half as
      likely as non-disabled people to have a degree and almost a quarter (23%),
      have no qualifications at all (Compared to 9% of the non-disabled
      population).
    </p>
    <p>
      Societal expectations of equal opportunity for disabled people to and at
      work is aligned with a shift from the traditional medical model of
      disability (which viewed disabled people as broken and in need of
      ‘fixing’) to a social model which focusses on removing, or reducing,
      societal barriers that can prevent disabled people from fulfilling their
      aspirations and realising their potential.
    </p>
    <p>The barriers are often classified as:</p>

      As discussed in element 1, the Equality Act 2010 protects groups with
      “protected characteristics” from discrimination. Disability is a protected
      characteristic and is defined as “a physical or mental impairment which
      has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their ability to carry
      out normal day-to-day activities”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employers are required to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to help disabled
      workers overcome any disadvantage arising from an impairment. Reasonable
      adjustments may be required in regard of:
