      Profit is the driving force in capitalist society and the history of
      health and safety legislation is one of companies trying to find loopholes
      for commercial advantage. A fall in the rate of profits in the
      industrialised world in the 1970s meant that many global businesses looked
      for new methods to lower costs and increase productivity. Large chunks of
      manufacturing were outsourced to the Asia-Pacific region where wages were
      low and health and safety concerns non-existent.

      Both the WHO and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) have warned

      diseases and injuries in the 21st century.

      In the least developed countries most workers are involved in production
      of raw materials, agriculture and mining. This means heavy and noisy
      physical work and exposure to pesticide sprays, dusts and parasitic and
      infectious diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
      In developing countries, less advanced and more hazardous technologies are
      being used. The lack of effective reporting and recording systems means
      that the extent of illnesses and injuries is unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effects of globalisation have also undermined workers conditions in
      the developed world, as nations, regions, governments and trade unions
      compete to provide the lowest costs to transnational corporations.
      Pressures for deregulation of the basic standards of health and safety are
      growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some multi-national organisations impact positively on standards in
      developing nations as their corporate standards and management system
      requirements are higher than local legislative requirements and local
      partners and supply chains are expected to work to those standards.
