      The risk profile of an organisation informs all aspects of the approach to
      leading and managing its health and safety risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every organisation will have its own risk profile. This is the starting
      point for determining the greatest health and safety issues for the
      organisation. In some businesses the risks will be tangible and immediate
      safety hazards, whereas in other organisations the risks may be
      health-related and it may be a long time before the illness becomes
      apparent.

      HSE accident statistics for 2018 / 19 shows that: health and social work,
      public administration, and education have ill health rates statistically
      significantly higher than the rate for all industries; and that
      agriculture, construction, manufacturing, the motor trade and hospitality
      (accommodation and food services) had statistically significantly higher
      injury rates than that for all industry.

      illness they believed was caused or made worse by their work and 693 000
      workers sustained a non-fatal injury at work. However, the risk of injury
      and work-related illness varies across industry, being more likely in some
      industries than others.

      The rates of self-reported work-related ill health in the following main
      industry sectors were statistically significantly higher than the average
