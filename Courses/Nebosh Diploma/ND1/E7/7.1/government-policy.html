    <p>
      In addition to the introduction of legislation the government can impact
      upon health and safety standards and priorities by focusing the resources
      of the HSE and other departments on particular issues; and through
      structured media campaigns and propaganda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years the government, through the HSC/HSE, government departments
      and other agencies such as the NHS has introduced numerous policies and
      initiatives focused on the health and/or safety of workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current HSE strategy “Helping Great Britain Work Well” was launched in
      February 2016 and sets the the strategic direction until 2020. There are
      six strategic themes:

      “Working for a healthier tomorrow” was Dame Carol Black’s review of the
      health of Britain’s working age population, the findings of which were
      presented to the Secretary of State for Health and the Secretary of State
      for Work and Pensions in March 2008.
    </p>
    <p>
      The review identified the need for a fundamental change in the perceptions
      that:

          that being at work normally impedes recovery.

      The review cited recent evidence showing that work can be good for health
      and can also help to reverse the harmful effects of long-term unemployment
      and prolonged sickness absence. (These issues are discussed in more detail
      later).
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time around 7% of workers were on incapacity benefits and an
      additional 3% were off work sick at any one time. Each year, 600 000
      people move onto incapacity benefits. The cost to the taxpayer in benefit
      costs, additional health costs and forgone taxes was estimated to be over
      £60 billion, with an overall cost in excess of £100 billion. (Greater than
      the annual budget for the NHS / equivalent to the entire GDP of Portugal).
    </p>
    <p>
      The three principal objectives arising from the reports vision for health
      and work in Britain are:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      In addition an early intervention “Fit for Work” service is to be
      provided; based on a case-managed, multidisciplinary approach, to provide
      treatment, advice and guidance for people in the early stages of sickness
      absence. (See also the notes on ‘Sickness absence and incapacity’ later)
