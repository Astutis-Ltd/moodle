    <p>
      The UK has an ageing population because of longer lifespans and reduced
      fertility rates. To be sustainable there will be a need for people to work
      longer and for an increased proportion of migrant workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the Office of National Statistics (ONS) in 2019 there were
      29.33 million UK nationals, 2.31 million EU nationals, and an estimated
      1.34 million non-EU nationals working in the UK. (i.e., around 10% of
      working age people are non-UK nationals).
    </p>
    <p>
      Over 80% of migrant workers are under 35 and many are highly qualified
      with around 70% having studied in the UK before entering the workforce,
      often in highly skilled and well-paid sectors including banking, IT,
      education and medicine. TUC (Trades Union Council) research has
      demonstrated that these workers receive no or very little additional risk
      to their health and safety at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other TUC research has shown that there are significant numbers of migrant
      workers employed in sectors that are low-paid and where zero-hours
      contracts are prevalent, such as food production, health and social care,
      hospitality, clothing manufacture and the gig economy. Workers in these
      sectors are likely to face an increased risk to their health and safety at
      work, particularly where English language skills are poor, residency
      status is at risk, or there are other vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      IOSH research in 2008 showed that many employers considered language
      barriers to be a problem but that 13/26 of the businesses surveyed had
      done nothing to improve health and safety communication to those with poor
      English language skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      HSE sponsored research considered whether migrant workers were at
      increased health and safety risk relative to indigenous workers in similar
      positions. The research findings identified the following concerns:
    </p>

          migrants are more likely to be working in sectors or occupations where
          there are existing health and safety concerns

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          their status as new workers may place them at added risk, due to their
          relatively short periods of work in the UK and limited knowledge of
          the UK’s health and safety system

          motivation for coming to the UK premised on earning as much as

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          limited means of communication between migrant workers and indigenous
          supervisors also may place these workers at greater risk.

    <p>
      HSE’s current advice to those who employ migrant workers is to focus on
      the following four areas to ensure their health and safety:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">Training:</span> Make sure induction training
          to familiarise workers with workplace risks and precautions is clear
          and simple
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">Communication:</span> Must be clear and
          effective. Where necessary information should be provided in other
          languages, visual formats or simple English. Workers must understand
          what is required of them and need to know how, and with whom, they can
          raise concerns
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">Competence:</span> Occupational qualifications
          or skills needed for the job should be checked before migrant workers
          start work. Skill levels gained from overseas qualifications (e.g. for
          forklift driving) should be reassessed
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">Attitude to health and safety:</span> Migrant
          workers may have different expectations about health and safety
          responsibilities, e.g. workers from some cultures may assume accidents
          are their own fault, or just inevitable. Efforts should be made to
          ensure that migrant workers understand the importance of health and
          safety in the workplace, and how it is managed.
