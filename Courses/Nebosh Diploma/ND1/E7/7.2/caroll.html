    <p>
      Archie Carrol (1979) came up with a four-part definitional framework for
      CSR which was originally stated as follows: “Corporate social
      responsibility encompasses the economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary
      (philanthropic) expectations that society has of organisations at a given
      point in time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The four responsibilities create a foundation or infrastructure that
      frames the nature of a businesses’ responsibilities to the society of
      which it is a part.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1991 Carroll recast his definition in the form of a CSR pyramid. The
      purpose of the pyramid was to move beyond a definition and to illustrate
      the building block nature of the four-part framework.

    <p>
      The <span class="ast-bold">economic responsibility</span> was placed as
      the base of the pyramid because it is a foundational requirement in
      business. Sustained profitability is essential to support society’s other
      expectations of the organisation. The infrastructure of CSR is built upon
      the premise of an economically sound and sustainable business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Society is increasingly showing business that they are required to comply
      with their <span class="ast-bold">legal responsibilities.</span> Law and
      regulations are the ground rules within which businesses must operate in a
      civil society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Businesses are also expected to operate in accordance with their
      <span class="ast-bold">ethical responsibilities.</span> This means that
      business has the expectation, and obligation, to do what is right, just,
      and fair and to avoid or minimise harm to all the stakeholders with whom
      it interacts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, businesses are expected to be a good ‘corporate citizens’,
      embracing their
      <span class="ast-bold">philanthropic responsibilities</span> and giving
      back to the communities of which they are part through contribution of
      financial, physical, and human resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      As companies seek to perform with respect to their various
      responsibilities, tensions and trade-offs inevitably arise. How companies
      decide to balance these responsibilities goes a long way towards defining
      their CSR orientation and reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, the economic responsibility to owners or shareholders
      requires a careful trade-off between short-term and long-term
      profitability. In the short-term, companies’ expenditures on legal,
      ethical and philanthropic obligations may appear to conflict with their
      responsibilities to their shareholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pyramid is a sustainable stakeholder framework Each of the four
      components of responsibility addresses different stakeholders in different
      ways:

          <span class="ast-bold">Legal responsibilities</span> are certainly

          <span class="ast-bold">Philanthropic responsibilities</span> most
          affect the community and non-profit organisations, but research has
          also shown that a company’s philanthropic involvement is significantly

    <p>
      The pyramid should be seen as sustainable in that these responsibilities
      represent long term obligations that overarch into future generations of
      stakeholders as well. The pyramid is intended to be seen as a dynamic,
      adaptable framework focussing on both the present and the future.
    </p>
    <p>CSR is inseparable from stakeholder requirements and sustainability.</p>
