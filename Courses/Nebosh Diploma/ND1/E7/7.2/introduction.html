      Philanthropic capitalism is not a new concept, during the industrial
      revolution (19th century) some manufacturers saw the importance of
      balancing profits against the social and physical wellbeing of their
      workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Second World War the growth of multinational companies and the
      complexities of the global economy brought the question of the
      relationship between business and society back to the forefront.
    </p>
    <p>
      The criteria used to define CSR today have been discussed in American and
      European academic literature since the 1950’s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The globalisation of economies, brands and financial markets continues to
      evolve and many businesses have adapted by restructuring their activities
      and relocating many activities to regions with ‘cheap’ labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greater ease of mobility, access to information, and the availability of
      instant communications have all contributed to the increasing concern
      about the social responsibility of organisations. Consumers, customers,
      shareholders and charitable donors all exert financial influence on
      organisations in relation to social responsibility.
