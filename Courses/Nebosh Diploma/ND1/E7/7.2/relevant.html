      The first standard for socially responsible employment was SA8000: 1998
      (SA = Social Accountability) which was developed by the then Council on
      Economic Priorities Accreditation Agency (CEPAA), which evolved into
      <span class="ast-bold">Social Accountability</span> International (SAI) -
      a global standard-setting non-governmental human rights organisation
      dedicated to improving workplaces and communities.

      In 2010
      <span class="ast-bold">ISO 26000 ‘Social Responsibility’ </span>was
      launched to assist organisations in contributing to sustainable
      development, encouraging them to go beyond legal compliance, and to
      promote common understanding in the field of social responsibility. ISO
      26000 provides guidance rather than requirements, so is not a certifiable
      standard.
