      The first standard for socially responsible employment was SA8000: 1998
      (SA = Social Accountability) which was developed by the then Council on
      Economic Priorities Accreditation Agency (CEPAA), which evolved into
      <strong>Social Accountability International </strong>(SAI) - a global
      standard-setting non-governmental human rights organisation dedicated to
      improving workplaces and communities.

      In 2010 <strong>ISO 26000 ‘Social Responsibility’ </strong>was launched to
      assist organisations in contributing to sustainable development,
      encouraging them to go beyond legal compliance, and to promote common
      understanding in the field of social responsibility. ISO 26000 provides
      guidance rather than requirements, so is not a certifiable standard.
