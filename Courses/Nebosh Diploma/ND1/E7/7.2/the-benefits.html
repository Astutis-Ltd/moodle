      Having a CSR policy and actively engaging in socially responsible
      practises shows stakeholders that the organisation cares about the
      communities it operates in and is actively taking steps to improve the
      local communities and environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can help to develop trust between the organisation and a range of
      stakeholders including workers, neighbours, customers and other supply
      chain partners.
    </p>

      The presence of trust can bring a range of business benefits including:

    <p>
      Conversely engaging with CSR superficially, in pursuit of business
      advantage often has negative consequences. There are many examples of
      organisations suffering serious reputational damage as a result of
      tokenism, opportunism or false representation.
