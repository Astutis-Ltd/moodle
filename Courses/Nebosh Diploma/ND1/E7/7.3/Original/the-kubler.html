    <br />
    <p>
      Dr. Elizabeth Kübler-Ross, a Swiss psychologist first explored the ‘five
      stages of death’ in her 1970 book “On Death and Dying”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also known as the ‘five stages of grieving’ the model was developed
      following extensive work with terminally ill patients and their families.
      It captured the most commonly observed stages of grief. The model does not
      describe a linear process. It is acknowledged that not all people go
      through all stages. Some people may experience only one or two and others
      may experience none at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kübler-Ross also found that the model worked in dealing with issues other
      than death, notably coping with disability, relationship problems, debt
      and work issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subsequently the Kübler-Ross model has been used to understand what
      workers experience psychologically during the transition period of
      organisational change where many workers effectively ‘mourn’ the loss of
      the status quo.
    </p>
    <p>
      This insight can help managers understand the position employees are in so
      far as adapting to change is concerned and can therefore help managers
      determine appropriate guidance and methods of communication for those on
      the change path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although referred to as the ‘five stages’ the process is often presented
      as six or seven stages on a curve. The graph below shows the curve as
      currently presented by the EKR Foundation.

      <h5>Shock and denial</h5>
      <p>
        The Stage of shock or denial is usually the first stage in the
        Kubler-Ross Model and is mostly short-lived. This is a phase during
        which one puts on a temporary defence mechanism and takes time to
        process certain disturbing news or reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, the manager’s role should be to help employees understand why the
        change is happening and how it can be helpful. Care must be taken to
        avoid overwhelming the employees with information.
      </p>

      <h5>Frustration (anger)</h5>
      <p>
        When the realisation hits, and the gravity of the situation is
        understood, the grieving person may become angry and may look for
        someone to blame.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this stage it is important that managers realise that workers may
        vent their anger in excessive ways. This should be understood as a
        natural reaction and the organisations efforts should remain on clear
        communication and provision of support mechanisms. When anger passes
        thoughts turn to ways to postpone the inevitable and try to find out the
        best thing left in the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this stage employees realise that they must adapt to new situations
        and circumstances and try to find the best possible scenario for them to
        fit in and adapt to. At this point they may try to negotiate with
        management. The organisations efforts should now shift to ensuring that
        everyone gets the best training to enable the change to be incorporated
        successfully. This may take time and should not be rushed.
      </p>

      <h5>Depression / experimentation</h5>
      <p>
        Depression is the stage in which the person tends to feel sadness, fear,
        regret, guilt and other negative emotions. Some employees may now
        realise that there is no way out of the situation, and this may prove
        difficult to handle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other employees may move into the experimenting or learning phase. This
        may also be challenging for many employees and could result in low
        energy and morale. The focus here should be on ensuring that the
        training given looks to excite the employees about the change and helps
        them to get ready to move on and get stuck in.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br /><br />
    <div
      style="
        background-color: #f6ecff;
        width: 725px;
        padding: 25px;
        margin: auto;
        border-radius: 10px;
      "

      <h5>Decision (acceptance) and integration</h5>
      <p>
        At this stage it is realised that fighting the change is not going to
        make the grief go away and the grieving person becomes resigned to the
        situation and accepts it completely.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this stage people begin to embrace the change, accept the situation
        and start building new hopes and aspirations. Some workers will still be
        negative and be resigned to the change, others will react in a more
        positive way. Changes become integrated.
