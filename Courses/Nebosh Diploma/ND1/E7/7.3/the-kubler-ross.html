    <p>
      Dr. Elizabeth Kübler-Ross, a Swiss psychologist first explored the ‘five
      stages of death’ in her 1970 book “On Death and Dying”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also known as the ‘five stages of grieving’ the model was developed
      following extensive work with terminally ill patients and their families.
      It captured the most commonly observed stages of grief. The model does not
      describe a linear process. It is acknowledged that not all people go
      through all stages. Some people may experience only one or two and others
      may experience none at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kübler-Ross also found that the model worked in dealing with issues other
      than death, notably coping with disability, relationship problems, debt
      and work issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subsequently the Kübler-Ross model has been used to understand what
      workers experience psychologically during the transition period of
      organisational change where many workers effectively ‘mourn’ the loss of
      the status quo.
    </p>
    <p>
      This insight can help managers understand the position employees are in so
      far as adapting to change is concerned and can therefore help managers
      determine appropriate guidance and methods of communication for those on
      the change path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although referred to as the ‘five stages’ the process is often presented
      as six or seven stages on a curve. The graph below shows the curve as
      currently presented by the EKR Foundation.

        <p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600">Shock and denial</p>
        <p>
          The Stage of shock or denial is usually the first stage in the
          Kubler-Ross Model and is mostly short-lived. This is a phase during
          which one puts on a temporary defence mechanism and takes time to
          process certain disturbing news or reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, the manager’s role should be to help employees understand why
          the change is happening and how it can be helpful. Care must be taken
          to avoid overwhelming the employees with information.

        <p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600">Frustration (anger)</p>
        <p>
          When the realisation hits, and the gravity of the situation is
          understood, the grieving person may become angry and may look for
          someone to blame.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this stage it is important that managers realise that workers may
          vent their anger in excessive ways. This should be understood as a
          natural reaction and the organisations efforts should remain on clear
          communication and provision of support mechanisms. When anger passes
          thoughts turn to ways to postpone the inevitable and try to find out
          the best thing left in the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this stage employees realise that they must adapt to new situations
          and circumstances and try to find the best possible scenario for them
          to fit in and adapt to. At this point they may try to negotiate with
          management. The organisations efforts should now shift to ensuring
          that everyone gets the best training to enable the change to be
          incorporated successfully. This may take time and should not be
          rushed.

          Depression / experimentation
        </p>
        <p>
          Depression is the stage in which the person tends to feel sadness,
          fear, regret, guilt and other negative emotions. Some employees may
          now realise that there is no way out of the situation, and this may
          prove difficult to handle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other employees may move into the experimenting or learning phase.
          This may also be challenging for many employees and could result in
          low energy and morale. The focus here should be on ensuring that the
          training given looks to excite the employees about the change and
          helps them to get ready to move on and get stuck in.

          Decision (acceptance) and integration
        </p>
        <p>
          At this stage it is realised that fighting the change is not going to
          make the grief go away and the grieving person becomes resigned to the
          situation and accepts it completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this stage people begin to embrace the change, accept the situation
          and start building new hopes and aspirations. Some workers will still
          be negative and be resigned to the change, others will react in a more
          positive way. Changes become integrated.
