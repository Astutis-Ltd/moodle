      Kurt Lewin, a physicist and social scientist first presented his model of
      organisational change in 1947. Using the analogy of changing the shape of
      a block of ice Lewin described a journey with a beginning, middle and end.
      Lewin’s simple
      <span class="ast-bold">“Unfreeze, Change, Refreeze”</span> model is still
      relevant and used today.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first stage of <span class="ast-bold">‘unfreezing’</span> is about
      getting ready to change and involves preparing
      <span class="ast-bold">people</span> for change by removing barriers and
      ideally creating a situation in which they want the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second <span class="ast-bold">‘transitioning’</span> stage requires a
      clearly mapped process with achievable ‘stepping-stones’ to the future
      state and feedback provided on successes, failures and lessons learned
      each step of the way. Careful thought should be given to workers and
      managers needs for information, training, coaching and support throughout
      the change process. Trying to effect a change too quickly or without
      worker engagement can be counter-productive leading to worker resistance
      and antipathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third <span class="ast-bold">‘refreezing’</span> stage is about
      establishing stability once the changes have been made, are accepted and
      become normalised. It takes time for people to form new relationships and
      become comfortable with the new routines. Ongoing reinforcement of the
      benefits of the change is essential to ensure the change is accepted and
      maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      As discussed earlier organisational changes can introduce significant
      hazards to safety and health. A proportionate, thorough assessment of the
      direct and indirect effects of the change on risk controls, throughout the
      transitional period and consequent to the change is important in ensuring
      effective ongoing management of risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is generally considered sensible to focus efforts on one significant
      change at a time and to proceed incrementally. Too many simultaneous
      changes, and rushed changes present opportunities for control to be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HSE has published guidance for employers on how to manage the impact
      of organisational change on their control of major accident hazards in
      accordance with a three-step process shown below.

      Risk assessment is required to ensure that following the change, the

      The risk assessments should result in action plans, milestones and
      identify key performance indicators that can be used to monitor the impact
      of the change process on the management of major hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resources should be sufficient to ensure that exposure to risks is not
      significantly increased during the change and the plans should account for
      an increase in workload during the transition.
    </p>

    <!--H4 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h4">
      <p>Monitoring and review</p>
    </div>
    <!--H4 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Risk assessments and plans for both the transition and progress should be
      regularly reviewed to determine progress against set objectives and key
      performance indicators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health and safety performance, during and after the change, should be
      subject to both proactive and reactive monitoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there is evidence of significant risk, decisions may need to be
      changed or reversed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the effects of change can be subtle or delayed it is important to plan
      reviews to check for the effects of change six to twelve months
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The review should ensure that lessons learnt from the change process are
      identified and taken on board in reviewing and updating the organisation’s
      change management procedures.
