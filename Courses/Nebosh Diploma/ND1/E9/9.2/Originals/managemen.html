        Management of contractors within the<br />supply chain<br />
      </h2>

    <br />
    <p>
      Cooperation and coordination of activities within a supply chain is a
      legal and practical necessity. Good communication is key and having
      appropriate systems in place to ensure that all actors understand the key
      hazards and control measures required before commencing work is a good
      starting point. As discussed, much of this can be addressed through
      effective site induction.

    <p>
      To paraphrase Molte the Elder, “<em
        >No plan survives contact with the enemy</em
      >”. It is important to recognise that plans may need to be modified during
      operational activity. It is also essential that these changes are
      recognised and assessed and that controls are changed as necessary. This
      must be done in a timely manner to ensure that all parties are properly
      informed and able to play their part effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there are multiple contractors engaged it is important that there is
      consistency of approach to risk assessment, safe systems and permits to
      work and incident reporting etc. It is generally accepted (Benevides et
      al, 2012) that for the best outcomes performance should be jointly managed
      and monitored by the client and contractors involved in the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to regular meetings throughout the project both the client and
      the contractor should review the work after completion to see if
      performance could be improved in future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The client should review both the job and the contractor. Consideration
      should be given to:
