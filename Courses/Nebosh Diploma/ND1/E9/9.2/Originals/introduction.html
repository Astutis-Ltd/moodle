    <p>
      Increasing globalisation and continued outsourcing requires companies to
      function and compete on a supply chain level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The growing importance of supply chains have implications for the working
      conditions and health and safety of workers of both the supplier and the
      contracting companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ‘supply chain’, as illustrated below, encompasses “all activities
      associated with the flow and transformation of goods from raw materials
      stage (extraction), through to the end user, as well as the associated
      information flows. Material and information flow both up and down the
      supply chain’” (Handfield and Ernest, 1999).

      There are two main supply chain networks or relationships between
      companies and the members of their supply chain:

          the<strong> primary network</strong> (<em>or supply chain</em>) - a
          company and its suppliers of certain goods and materials. Companies
          are linked through information, knowledge, materials, and capital
          flows.
        </p>
        <p>
          A chain suggests that companies are linked in a straight line. This is
          often seen as a primary network of companies, in which production,
          distribution and sales of goods occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          A focal company can use a diversity of instruments to influence the
          members of its supply chain to apply sustainable OSH practices, such
          as economic pressure or incentives, or policies to deal with
          suppliers, retailers and purchasers. and;

          A <strong>‘supplier’</strong> is a party that supplies goods or
          services, whereas a <strong>contractor </strong>or
          <strong>subcontractor</strong> commonly adds specialised input to
          deliverables.
        </div>
        <p>
          the <strong>secondary network</strong> (<em>or contracting chain</em>)
          - a company and its contractors and subcontractors providing specific
          services such as maintenance, construction, cleaning or catering.
          Comprises a flow of people and their services (contracting and
          sub-contracting). Companies are linked through information, knowledge,
          people and capital flows.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is getting more and more common for construction work, maintenance
          projects and other work (ICT, cleaning, catering) to be performed by
          contractors. Often this work is of a sporadic nature which implies
          that employees are needed only temporarily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specialised companies and their employees are hired to perform the
          work better, faster and usually cheaper. These specialist contractors
          may then hire sub-contractors creating a contracting chain. The work
          takes place mostly at the premises of the focal company /
          organisation.

      <strong>‘Supply Chain Management (SCM)’ </strong>requires “the integration
      of these activities through improved supply chain relationships to achieve
      a sustainable competitive advantage”.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <strong>‘focal company’</strong> forms the centre of the supply chain.
      It is provided with goods / materials from suppliers and concludes
      contracts with companies who act as service or production providers.
