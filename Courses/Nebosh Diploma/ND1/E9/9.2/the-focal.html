    <p>
      Focal companies of supply chains might be held responsible for the
      environmental and social performance of their suppliers, especially if
      they are a customer facing brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main triggers for a focal company to take actions for promoting and
      supporting improvement in OSH in the supply chain are:

    <p>
      These reputational risk issues have consequently resulted in many focal
      companies taking proactive action to promote more socially responsible
      performance amongst their suppliers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly, there are potential health and safety implications which might
      ensue as a result of supply chain governance by a focal company. For
      example, outsourcing to specialist organisations that have a better
      understanding (and therefore control) of specific health and safety risks
      would seem to be an obviously positive impact. However, if the cost
      pressure on suppliers causes a reduction in the health and safety
      resources necessary for safe working the impact is clearly negative.
      (Walters and James, 2009).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important that the pressure exerted by a focal company is
      proportionate to the risk. It is known that focal companies operating in
      traditional high-risk sectors, such as the petrochemical industry, pay
      evidently more attention towards OSH matters in their contracting chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HSE (2019) has long been concerned about
      <span class="ast-bold">‘blue tape’</span>

        >(“obligations imposed not by government regulation, but by businesses
        or business intermediary organisations”)</span
      >
      leading to ineffective or disproportionate risk control, excessive
      administrative burdens and sometimes fear and confusion amongst smaller
      businesses in the supply chain.

      The graphic below, adapted from the UNGC (2010), presents the range of
      different instruments available for engaging with suppliers. The ambition
      is to achieve deep engagement by ultimately working in partnership.
