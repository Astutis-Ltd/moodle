    <p>
      Increasing globalisation and continued outsourcing requires companies to
      function and compete on a supply chain level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The growing importance of supply chains have implications for the working
      conditions and health and safety of workers of both the supplier and the
      contracting companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ‘supply chain’, as illustrated below, encompasses “all activities
      associated with the flow and transformation of goods from raw materials
      stage (extraction), through to the end user, as well as the associated
      information flows. Material and information flow both up and down the
      supply chain’” (Handfield and Ernest, 1999).

    <p>
      There are two main supply chain networks or relationships between
      companies and the members of their supply chain:

            the <span class="ast-bold">primary network</span>

            its suppliers of certain goods and materials. Companies are linked

          <p>
            A chain suggests that companies are linked in a straight line. This
            is often seen as a primary network of companies, in which
            production, distribution and sales of goods occur.

            A focal company can use a diversity of instruments to influence the
            members of its supply chain to apply sustainable OSH practices, such

            suppliers, retailers and purchasers. and;

            It is getting more and more common for construction work,
            maintenance projects and other work (ICT, cleaning, catering) to be
            performed by contractors. Often this work is of a sporadic nature
            which implies that employees are needed only temporarily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specialised companies and their employees are hired to perform the
            work better, faster and usually cheaper. These specialist
            contractors may then hire sub-contractors creating a contracting
            chain. The work takes place mostly at the premises of the focal
            company / organisation.
