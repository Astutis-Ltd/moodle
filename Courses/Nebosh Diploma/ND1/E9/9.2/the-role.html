      Management systems can be used to establish minimum performance standards
      required within the supply chain with expectations that suppliers’ systems
      will dovetail effectively with those of the focal company.

    <p>
      There are also potential benefits for the supplier in that if they are
      independently audited and third party certificated as meeting an
      appropriate standard they should not need to be separately audited by each
      of their customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The certification bodies approval also expresses ‘justified confidence’ in
      the supplier which can be commercially beneficial in marketing their
      services.
