      Modern slavery is the severe exploitation of other people for personal or
      commercial gain. The term encompasses slavery, servitude, forced and
      compulsory labour and human trafficking. Although these activities are
      unlawful modern slavery is a problem in every country in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are believed to be over 40 million people enslaved worldwide,
      generating an estimated US$150 billion in illegal profits per year. Types
      of slavery include child trafficking, forced labour / debt bondage, sexual
      exploitation, criminal exploitation and domestic servitude.
    </p>
    <p>Modern slavery occurs in every industry including:</p>

          At the 2017 G20 Summit in Germany, member countries signed a
          declaration to eradicate all forms of modern slavery. The declaration
          specified the responsibility of businesses to ensure their supply
          chains are free from forced labour, child labour and other forms of
          modern slavery.

      The UK is regarded as a world-leader for its response to modern slavery,
      introducing a Modern Slavery Strategy in 2014 and the first legislation to
      address modern slavery in the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The USA and
      Australia introduced their own Modern Slavery Acts in 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UK Act requires ‘commercial organisations’ who carry on a business or
      part of a business in the UK supplying goods or services with a minimum
      annual turnover of £36 million to publish a slavery and human trafficking
      statement each financial year on their website (if they have one).

      The UK’s Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) uses its
      global standards, networks, and expertise to ensure that procurement and
      supply chain management professionals have the capabilities and
      responsibility to deliver sustainability goals for their organisations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CIPS view is that procurement professionals have an important role to
      play in sourcing in a manner that enables and rewards suppliers for good
      employment practices, rather than purchasing in a manner which drives the
      use of modern-day slavery practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      CIPS (2013) has developed a framework for organisations to demonstrate
      that they are taking the necessary due diligence to keep their supply
      chains slavery free as part of a wider risk management strategy addressing
      all ethical and sustainable procurement practices.
