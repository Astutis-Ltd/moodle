      Several contractor safety certification schemes, such as the Contractors
      Health and Safety Assessment Scheme (CHAS) and the National Access and
      Scaffolding Confederation (NASC), which via appropriate membership, enable
      organisations to demonstrate their health and safety management
      credentials. The purpose of such schemes is to enable buyers (procurers)
      to ask suppliers to be accredited to a particular scheme and so provide
      evidence of compliance with basic health and safety law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutual recognition between different accreditation schemes is facilitated
      by the Safety Systems in Procurement (SSIP) organisation, with SSIP member
      schemes applying core criteria approved by the HSE (SSIP 2020).

      Specific HSE registrations are also required for persons working with, for
      example, both piped natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG),
      asbestos, and with ionising radiation.

    <p>
      The ‘Gas Safe’ Register is the official list of gas businesses who are
      registered to work safely and legally on gas appliances. All gas engineers
      must be on the Gas Safe Register.
    </p>
    <p>The Register is not a membership body or trade association.</p>
    <p>
      A business can only be registered if it has at least one gas safety
      qualified engineer, and a gas engineer can only be aligned to a registered
      business and be issued with a license to undertake gas work if they hold a
      valid and current qualification.
