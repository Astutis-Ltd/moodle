        <strong>Note:</strong> The syllabus assumes a good working knowledge of
        the relevant sections of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974,
        Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, the
        Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 and HSG159
        Managing Contractors: An Employers Guide.

    <p>
      Contractors must be made aware of the expected standards of performance.
      Health and safety arrangements, procedures, permit systems and safety
      policy statement should be shared with the contractor who should confirm
      their understanding and agree to work accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The client should clearly identify all aspects of the work they want the
      contractor to do, including work falling within the preparation and
      completion phases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the client and prospective contractor should be involved in the risk
      management process.
    </p>
    <p>
      The client should already have a risk assessment for the work activities
      of his own business. The contractorâ€™s role involves assessing the risks
      for the contracted work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The client and the contractor need to agree the risk assessment for the
      contracted work and the preventative and protective steps that will apply
      when the work is in progress. If subcontractors are involved, they should
      also be part of the discussion and agreement.
    </p>
