    <p>
      Before work commences it is essential that checks are made on the
      competence of the personnel arriving on site to do the work and that they
      have all the equipment and materials necessary to undertake the job
      safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case of R v Associated Octel 1996 provides a clear illustration of the
      importance of this stage. In June 1990, while the Associated Octel plant
      was shut down for annual maintenance, a firm called Resin Glass Products
      Ltd (RGP) was engaged in repairing the lining of a tank. One of RGPâ€™s
      employees was cleaning the lining of the tank with acetone, which he had
      in an old paint bucket. The electric bulb of the inspection lamp he was
      using broke and ignited the flammable vapour from the acetone in the
      bucket. This caused a flash fire which badly burned the RGP employee.
    </p>

      The House of Lords held that Associated Octel had breached the
      requirements of section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act by not
      ensuring that RGP and Mr Cuthbert had the appropriate equipment to
      undertake the job safely, e.g. a lamp suitable for use in a flammable
      atmosphere, a closed container for the acetone, or forced air extraction
      for the tank.
