    <p>
      Accidents involving contractors are often caused by poor communication,
      e.g. where client staff don’t know there is a contractor working nearby or
      when contractors don’t know the dangers on site.
    </p>
    <p>
      The client and the contractor must work together and coordinate their
      activities, to make sure the work can be done safely and without risks to
      health. The level of cooperation and coordination needed will depend on:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">the job to be done;</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">the risks involved; and</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the number of contractors (or subcontractors) involved.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      One way of doing this is to have regular meetings throughout the work
      (pre-commencement, progress and close-out meetings).
    </p>
    <p>
      Contractors and their workers need to be told about the hazards they will
      face when they come onto site. An induction talk is often the best way for
      the client to pass this information on. Checks should be made to ensure
      that the contractors have understood any essential points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Site health and safety rules are often documented addressing a range of
      issues such as:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">signing in and out of site,</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          personal protective equipment requirements,
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          access requirements for danger areas,
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          safe systems of work and permits-to-work,
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">active monitoring arrangements,</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          emergency response requirements etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Contractors need to be told about these. The contractor should be
      furnished with the site rules in advance so that they are familiar before
      commencing work. Familiarity with the site rules can be assessed during
      the site induction process.
