      Specialist contractors are used by many organisations to support existing
      in-house resources, for example in construction, manufacturing, and the
      service sector. Typically, such specialists provide health and safety
      technical support in the form of specific hazard surveys, risk assessments
      and control options, monitoring and testing activities, and health
      surveillance. Dependent on the type of issue to be addressed, confirmation
      of compliance or otherwise with health and safety regulations such as
      hazardous or dangerous substances, noise and vibration, etc., is an
      essential output from such specialists.

    <p>
      Guidance from the British Occupational Hygiene Society (BOHS, 2019) for
      selecting specialist contractors such as occupational hygienists, for
      detailed or technical work, or work involving the use of specialist
      equipment, suggests that employers should consider the following general
      questions:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          What is the challenge that I am seeking to address?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          If I engage specialist help, what do I need it to do for me?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Will the specialist help be good enough to solve my problem?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Answers to those questions will better inform the process and lead on to
      more specific competence-related questions such as:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Do they have evidence of relevant competence, such as formal
          qualifications and training?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Do they have practical experience related to the industry, or
          processes?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Can they explain why they are competent to advise on this problem?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Do they have the resources to complete the work within the required
          timescale?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Will they need to sub-contract the work or any part of the work?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Can they provide references for completed work that is like the
          project being undertaken?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Are they a member of a relevant professional body, for example being
          included in the list of BOHS Directory of Occupational Hygiene
          Consultants?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Other factors to consider are:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Consultant competence and supervision – are there identified
          competences for the work and also are there effective processes to
          train, assess and monitor staff?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Quotations – is everyone involved clear on the scope of work?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Report writing and quality control – who will do this?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Co-operation and co-ordination – has relevant information for planning
          the work been shared? Are the relevant processes and staff available?
          Has suitable safe access / egress been provided? Who will make checks
          during the work?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>Effectiveness of solutions and follow-up support:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Is the report practical and sensible? Is it factually incorrect or not
          easily understood? Does it refer to published guidance for report
          writing?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Is it clear as to what the law requires, what the consultant’s
          professional judgement is, and also what is it that ‘must be done
          legally’ and what ‘could be done’ as best practise?
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Is there a process for dealing with complaints?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Whilst the information above is provided by the BOHS to assist employers
      in selecting external occupational hygienists, it can be applied to other
      specialist contractor activities. Specific industry professional bodies,
      such as those dealing with fire safety, process safety, ergonomics,
      building and civil engineering provide further details as to the
      competency requirements for membership, including continued professional
      development (CPD).
