    <p>
      Contractors will be selected based upon a range of criteria including
      availability, cost, technical competence, reliability and health and
      safety performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The client has to take reasonable steps to satisfy themselves that the
      contractor is competent to do the job safely and without risks to health
      and safety.
    </p>
    <p>The degree of competence required will depend on the work to be done.</p>
    <p>
      The best way of being satisfied of a contractor’s competence is through
      first-hand experience. A contractor is demonstrably competent if they have
      previously been used successfully on a similar job (through a cycle of
      risk management, monitoring and review).
    </p>
    <p>
      A pre-tender questionnaire (PTQ) may be used to broadly determine the
      suitability of a contractor. Questions should be designed to check the
      contractors:
