    <p>
      The origin of the concept of situational awareness is often attributed to
      Oswald Boelke, a German pilot in the first World War, regarded as the
      ‘father of air-combat’. Boelke realised ‘the importance of gaining an
      awareness of the enemy before the enemy gained a similar awareness’, and
      devised methods for accomplishing this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea gained prominence in the technical and academic literature in the
      late 1980’s. The initial push for research and development came from the
      aviation industry, where there is considerable pressure for pilots and air
      traffic controllers to develop better situational awareness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of the research to date has been conducted in aviation, which has
      obvious safety implications. It is argued that the concepts could be
      extended to other safety critical domains such as power generation,
      petro-chemical, nuclear, command and control, medicine, etc. In essence,
      any task that requires people to keep track of events is a potential
      candidate for situational assessment research and application.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of modern theories of situational awareness, one of the
      major ones is Endsley’s Model of Situation Awareness in Dynamic Risk
      Assessment as shown in the below figure.
    </p>

    <img

      alt=""
      class="ast-img"
    />

    <p>
      Endsley (1988) defined situational awareness as
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >“the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of
        time and space, the comprehension of their meaning and a projection of
        their status in the near future.”</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The model was developed initially to understand aviation tasks such as
      piloting aircraft and air traffic control in the US air force where people
      are required to keep up to date with a dynamically changing environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three levels of situational awareness represent ascending levels of
      situational awareness, not a hierarchical progression. A person who
      <span class="ast-bold">comprehends</span> the current situation has better
      situational awareness than one who can
      <span class="ast-bold">perceive</span> the data on a screen but does not
      know what it means, and a person who can
      <span class="ast-bold">project</span> the likely future events and states
      of the system and environment has better situational awareness than one
      who cannot.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this model, it can be seen that the main ways of improving
      situational awareness are through ergonomic system design and developing
      the competence of the workers engaging with the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      More recently the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL), in collaboration
      with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and principal contractors in
      the construction sector has developed the Leadership and Worker
      Involvement toolkit to help small and medium sized construction sites
      improve their health and safety performance through engaging with their
      workforce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Situational awareness is one of the major tools in the toolkit. The
      toolkit defines it as
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >“being aware of what is happening around you in terms of where you are,
        where you are supposed to be, and whether anyone or anything around you
        is a threat to your health and safety,”</span
      >
      and considers that an individual’s knowledge, experience and education is
      key in helping a worker to understand what is going on around them in
      determining if it is safe to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temporary loss or lack of situational awareness is a causal factor in
      many construction accidents. This can occur because there is so much
      ‘going on’ in the working environment, or a worker becomes so absorbed in
      their own thoughts, that they fail to spot those things that could pose a
      serious threat to their health and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Situational awareness can be further reduced in times of high workload or
      when under pressure to get a job done to time. In these situations, it is
      essential to maintain a high level of situational awareness to stop
      accidents and near misses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Situational awareness is only as accurate as the individual’s perception
      or reading of the situation, so what they think is happening may not
      accurately reflect reality. How a situation is read can be influenced by
      many things such as the type of information given, personal experience and
      distractions in the workplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important that workers know how many problems they face and how
      serious they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic approach requires workers to pause and make a quick mental
      assessment of the working environment, considering the following
      questions:
    </p>

    <p>
      Risk assessment should be viewed as a means to an end rather than an end
      in itself. The reason risks are assessed is to ensure that they are
      effectively controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risk assessment and risk control are parts of the larger process of risk
      management. An effective risk management system should assess the risks
      that arise in the workplace, put in place sensible health and safety
      measures to control them and then make sure that they work in practice.

      The Approved Code of Practice (ACoP) to the Management of Health and
      Safety at Work Regulations (withdrawn) acknowledged that that the
      principles are not an individually prescriptive requirement but general
      principles that should be applied wherever it is reasonable to do so. The
      ACoP further suggested that adopting good practice (ACoP / HSE Guidance /
      BS EN ISO standards / Industry guides or standards) will be enough to
      ensure risks are reduced sufficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ACoP also offered additional interpretation on the principles of
      prevention, as follows. (Note: the order and content varied from Schedule
      1 – and no reference was made to replacing the dangerous by the
      non-dangerous or the less dangerous).

      <p>Hierarchies of control</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      There are many hierarchical approaches to risk management defined in
      legislation, guidance and standards or in general use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hierarchies should be applied with caution, the overarching goals of
      getting the job done, keeping people safe, and complying with the law
      should not be lost sight of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any individual control measure is likely to have weaknesses and a
      combination of controls will be more reliable than any individual control.
      The ‘best’ control option for any particular hazard should be considered
      carefully in context.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hierarchy of control from ISO 45001 is specifically referenced in the
      NEBOSH Diploma syllabus. The hierarchy with examples is shown in the below
      table.

    <p>
      As has been seen there are numerous approaches to determining the ‘best’
      risk control options. Ultimately the decision regarding the control
      measures will involve a degree of compromise. The following issues should
      be considered:

          The cost of the control measures. Some risk control measures can be
          introduced relatively cheaply but thereafter are expensive to

          cheaper to maintain. Generally the measures at the bottom of the
          hierarchy – SSW / PPE are cheaper in the short term – but will have

      Employers are required to do all that is ‘reasonably practicable’ to
      protect the health and safety of their employees and others at work.

    <p>
      Determining whether or not a control measure is ‘reasonably practicable’
      requires a balancing of the costs of dealing with the risk (money, time,
      effort) against the risk of injury (likelihood × severity).

      The greater the risk the greater the efforts expected to control the risk.
      If there is gross disproportion between the two, i.e. significant
      resources are required for minimal risk improvement then it may be argued
      that the control is not reasonably practicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objective is to manage risks to a tolerable level* which is one that
      people are willing to live with because it delivers certain benefits, and
      because there is confidence that the risk is being properly controlled

      The costs considered should only be those necessary and sufficient for
      implementing the control measure (not the gold plated or deluxe version).
      Any savings as a result of the measure (for example: reduced operational
      costs, avoidance of damage and reinstatement costs if relevant) should be
      counted as ‘cost savings’ and offset against the above costs. They should

    <p>
      All benefits of a measure should be included. If a risk reduction measure

      HSE produces annual cost estimates of injuries and new cases of
      ill-health.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these total cost estimates, unit costs are calculated by dividing the
      total costs to society (as calculated by the HSE Cost to Britain model) by
      the number of new incidence cases for each category of injury and ill
      health.

      The unit costs to society per each incidence of workplace injury and

    <p>
      Before looking to implement any new work programmes or processes it is
      important to consider what needs to be done pre-implementation to prepare
      the organisation for the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will typically involve careful scoping of the project and good
      consultation and communication with management and workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding the requirements of the programme in providing both
      operational safety at the point of work and management information to
      enable effective strategic management of risks is important in the scoping
      stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effective consultation and communication is essential in ensuring that all
      stakeholders understand the need for the programme and are ‘on-side’ and
      that any potential barriers to successful implementation are understood
      and addressed early.
    </p>
    <p>
      Practical considerations of implementation can be reviewed by considering

      monitored to determine their initial and ongoing effectiveness. The
      management control loop will then need to be closed with a formal review
      and the specification of any follow on actions.
