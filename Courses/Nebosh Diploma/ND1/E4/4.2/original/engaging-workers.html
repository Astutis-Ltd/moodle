        Engaging workers in the risk assessment<br />process<br />
      </h2>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      A risk assessment should be completed by someone with a knowledge of the
      activity, process or material that is being assessed. Workers and their
      safety representatives are a valuable source of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a real difference between ‘work as imagined’ (the way management
      believes that work should be done) and ‘work as done’ (the way operational
      staff actually work at the sharp end, reacting to the work and the working
      environment).
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaining insight into the way work is actually done delivers a more
      authentic risk assessment and the development of pragmatic controls that
      allow workers to work safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      If workers are involved in risk assessment and the development of risk
      controls they are invested in the process and are more likely to own the
      risk controls and work in accordance with them.
