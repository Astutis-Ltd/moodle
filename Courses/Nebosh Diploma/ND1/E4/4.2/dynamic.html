    <p>
      In 1998 the Home Office and fire service produced operational guidance on
      dynamic risk assessment, defining it as the:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        continuous assessment of risk in the rapidly changing circumstances of
        an operational incident, in order to implement the control measures
        necessary to ensure an acceptable level of safety
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      Dynamic risk assessments are also used by the police, railways, nuclear
      industry and production-line maintenance. The approach is relevant in
      almost any work environment where the situation is constantly changing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fire and Rescue Authorities utilise a three level approach to risk
      management much like that advocated by Asbury and Jacobs (2014). At the
      <span class="ast-bold">strategic</span> level, at the
      <span class="ast-bold">systematic</span> level where general predictive
      risk assessments are undertaken and risk controls prescribed and at the
      <span class="ast-bold">dynamic/incident</span> level which is where
      dynamic risk assessment is relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaches to dynamic risk assessment acknowledge the premise that
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >no plan of operations extends with any certainty beyond the first
        contact with the main hostile force (von Moltke, 1871).</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      As circumstances change risk may need to be re-evaluated in real time.
      Although the situation is dynamic the risks are usually predictable based
      upon experience. The process may therefore be better understood as
      managing predictable risk in a dynamic situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dynamic risk assessments are not an excuse to avoid more formal,
      documented predictive risk assessments by relying on professional
      judgements. The groundwork at the strategic and systematic levels must
      have been done. Frameworks must be in place to help operational staff make
      appropriate risk management decisions in dynamic situations. Predictable
      risks must have been identified wherever possible and appropriate control
      strategies, including appropriate systems, equipment and competence levels
      specified.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an operational environment where a ‘safe place’ cannot be guaranteed
      the risk management focus shifts to ‘safe person’, safe equipment and safe
      systems of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Operational staff must be selected and trained to ensure they are able to
      identify hazards, determine if risk control is possible and if it is
      determine appropriate risk control strategies. Where risk control is not
      possible they must be empowered to stop the job, remove themselves from
      risk, or call for additional support.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Fire and Rescue Services dynamic risk assessments may well need to
      be used by the incident controller to coordinate team efforts and by
      individual fire-fighters that are operationally engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many Fire and Rescue Services use the ‘stand and run’ model as the
      framework for risk management decision making by the incident controller
      and the STAR model to aid individual decision making.
