    <p>
      Inspection techniques are observational in nature and involve looking at a
      workplace, item of equipment or activity to identify hazards – especially
      those that are not adequately controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many hazards are not visible to the naked eye and therefore cannot be
      observed. Some hazards are transient rather than permanent and may not be
      present at the time of a particular inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another factor to consider when using observational techniques is that
      people can behave very differently when they know they are being watched.
      Prior notifications of observations can be useful in giving the workforce
      an opportunity to show that they know how to behave appropriately, follow
      systems, and wear PPE etc. Unannounced observations should gain a more
      realistic view of what goes on in practise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multiple perspectives are useful in safety inspections. Someone with hands
      on operational experience will have a real world view of practice, whereas
      a ‘fresh pair of eyes’ can often add insight.
