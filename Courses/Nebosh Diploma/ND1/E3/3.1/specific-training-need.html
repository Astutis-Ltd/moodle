    <p>Regulation 7 of PUWER (Specific risks) specifies that:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        Where the use of work equipment is likely to involve a specific risk to
        health or safety, ...the use of that work equipment is restricted to
        those persons given the task of using it, and repairs, modifications,
        maintenance or servicing of that work equipment is restricted to those
        persons who have been specifically designated to perform [those]
        operations.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      Where the risks from the use of work equipment cannot be adequately
      controlled by hardware measures, such as guards or protection devices,
      either during its normal operation, or during repair, maintenance, or
      other similar work, only the persons whose task it is should be allowed to
      use such equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those persons should receive sufficient information, instruction and
      training to enable them to carry out the work safely, and in the case of
      repair, maintenance, or other similar work should be designated for the
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The requirement for the provision of adequate health and safety
      information and, where appropriate, written instructions for the use of
      the work equipment, is contained in Regulation 8 of PUWER – Information
      and instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regulation 9 of PUWER requires every employer to ensure that all persons
      who use work equipment have received adequate training for purposes of
      health and safety, including training in:

    <p>The Approved Code of Practice to PUWER, Regulation 9 states that:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        All workers who use a chainsaw should be competent to do so. Before
        using a chainsaw to carry out work on or in a tree, a worker should have
        received appropriate training and obtained a relevant certificate of
        competence or national competence award, unless they are undergoing such
        training and are adequately supervised. However, in the agricultural
        sector, this requirement only applies to first-time users of a chainsaw.

    <p>
      LANTRA, the Sector Skills Council (SSC) for land based training, approves
      training courses for chainsaw use. The National Proficiency Tests Council
      (NPTC) issues a certificate of competence for those who successfully
      complete the training and are able to demonstrate competent use.

      People who supervise or manage the use of power presses must be provided

      Such training should include the safe operation of the press and the risks

      No one should be allowed to work at a woodworking machine unless they have

      Operators that are deemed competent should then be authorised in writing

      <span class="ast-bold">Authorisation</span> should not be given unless the

    <p>
      The authorisation should list those machines and operations for which
      authorisation is given and it should be made clear to the operator that

      A copy of the authorisation should be given to the operator for their

      Training courses are offered by many organisations which usually provide a
      certificate of attendance, not competence. Further information can be
      obtained from the British Abrasives Federation.

      Considering rider operated lift trucks as an example the L117 ACoP

      Following satisfactory completion of training, the employee should be

    <p>
      <span class="ast-italic">Note:</span> authorisation to operate one type of
