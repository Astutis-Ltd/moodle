      Training provides an opportunity for employees to develop new knowledge
      and / or skills, and contributes to the development of competence.
    </p>
    <p>Regulation 9 of PUWER requires every employer to ensure that:</p>

    <p>
      What constitutes ‘adequate training’ will vary according to the job or
      activity and work equipment, etc. To ensure that training is adequate it
      will be necessary to:

        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Account should also be taken of the circumstances in which the employee
      works, such as whether they work alone or under the close supervision of a
      competent person.

    <p>
      Training upon recruitment provides an early opportunity to provide new
      starters with health and safety information and to make an impression
      regarding expected standards of behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aims of health and safety induction training are to provide new
      starters with the information necessary to keep themselves and others safe
      as they familiarise themselves with the site, its activities and their
      roles and responsibilities.

      <p>Additional training</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Additional training will be required whenever workplace changes introduce
      new risks or increase existing risks e.g. the introduction of new or
      significantly changed processes, equipment or procedures.
    </p>
    <p>Other drivers for health and safety training include:</p>

    <p>
      People who are transferred or promoted into a new job will invariably face
      new hazards and responsibilities. Wrong assumptions may be made about
      their competence and they may be reluctant to make their limitations
      public.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Competences will erode over time if unpractised – this is one of the main
      reasons for regular refresher training for first-aiders, providing an
      opportunity to reinforce and refresh skills in a safe environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Particular attention should be paid to people who deputise occasionally,
      as they may need more frequent refresher training than those who do the
      work regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular refresher training can also provide an opportunity for an exchange
      of views between older, experienced staff and younger staff which can help
      with motivation and norming of attitudes.

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->

      <p>Training for young people</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      All employees should be competent to use work equipment with due regard to
      health and safety regardless of their age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Training and proper supervision of young people is particularly important
      because of their relative immaturity and unfamiliarity with the working
      environment. Induction training is of particular importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MHSWR require employers to assess risks to young people (under 18
      years of age) before they start work.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no general age restrictions in legislation relating to the use
      of work equipment, although ACoPs advise against employing young people to
      operate power presses and wood working machinery.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Training for managers and supervisors</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      People who supervise or manage the use of work equipment must also be
      provided with adequate training.
    </p>
    <p>
      The training should include the safe operation of the work equipment, the
      risks posed to the person carrying out the work, and any preventive and
      protective measures in place to safeguard the equipment users and others
      affected.
