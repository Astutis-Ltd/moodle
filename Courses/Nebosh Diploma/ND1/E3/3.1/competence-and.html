      The supervisor (or team leader) has the potential to exert great influence
      over the organisation’s ability to achieve health and safety objectives

      Levels of supervision are determined by the risk of the job and the
      competence of the person.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is management’s job to decide on the appropriate level of supervision
      for particular tasks. The level depends on the risks involved as well as
      the competence of employees to identify and handle them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A degree of supervision of fully competent individuals will always be
      needed to ensure that standards are being met consistently.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also instances when a greater degree of supervision is required.
      Examples include:
