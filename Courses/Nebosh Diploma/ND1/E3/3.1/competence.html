      Competence, in the health and safety context, is legally defined within
      case law from the 1960s onwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case of Brasier v. Skipton Rock Company
      <span class="ast-bold">(1962)</span> determined that a competent person
      is:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        A man who on fair assessment of the requirement of the task, the factors
        involved, the problems to be studied and the degree of danger implicit,
        can fairly, as well as reasonably, be regarded by the manager as
        competent to perform such an inspection.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>This case also placed the onus on the manager to make the judgment.</p>
    <p>
      In Gibson v. Skibs A / S Marina (1966) a ‘competent person’ was considered
      to be one who is a practical and reasonable person, who knows what to look
      for and how to recognise it when he or she sees it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach is consistent with the general UK approach to competence
      through occupational standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the late 1970s and early 1980s, faced with rising unemployment and the
      eradication of traditional industry, the government established the
      Manpower Services Commission (MSC) as a vehicle to improve workplace
      skills and employee mobility. The approach taken was focused on defining
      desired outcomes from operational activities and became known as a
      competence based approach, eventually leading to the system of National
      Vocational Qualifications (NVQs).
    </p>
    <p>
      The definition of occupational competence provided by the Manpower
      Services Commission (MSC) and Investors in People (IiP) is:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        …the ability to perform activities in the jobs within an occupation, to
        the standards expected in employment.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      More recently, competence has been defined within the Management of Health
      and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 (MHSWR) as the ability to perform to a
      required standard.
    </p>
    <p>Regulation 7 of MHSWR states:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        A person shall be regarded as competent...where he has sufficient
        training and experience or knowledge and other qualities to enable him
        properly to assist in undertaking the measures referred to...
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      This definition makes reference to standards, thus competence assessment
      is necessary to ensure that a person can perform to the required standard.
