      The requirements to provide information and warnings are shared between
      the suppliers of machinery and other work equipment under, for example,
      the Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 2008 and the employer under,
      for example, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998.

      states that:

      <p>
        Before machinery is placed on the market or put into service, the

      Part 1.7 of the ‘general remarks’ on the essential health and safety
      requirements (EHSRs), relating to the design and construction of machinery
      deals with the supplier’s requirements regarding the provision of
      information.

    <p>
      Information and warnings on the machinery should preferably be provided in
      the form of readily understandable symbols or pictograms. Any written or
      verbal information and warnings must be expressed in an official Community
      language or languages. The information needed to control machinery must be
      provided in a form that is unambiguous and easily understood. It must not
      be excessive to the extent of overloading the operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where residual risks remain, despite the inherent safe design measures,
      safeguarding and complementary protective measures adopted, the necessary
      warnings, including warning devices, must be provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where a fault in the operation of unsupervised machinery may cause danger,
      appropriate acoustic or light warning signals are required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warning devices must be unambiguous and easily perceived, and the operator
      must have facilities to check the operation of the warning devices at all
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      The requirements of the Health and Safety (Safety Signs and Signals)
      Regulations concerning colours and safety signals must be complied with.

    <p>
      Written instructions can include the information provided by manufacturers

      <p>Regulation 24: Warnings</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Every employer shall ensure that work equipment incorporates any warnings
      or warning devices which are appropriate for reasons of health and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be appropriate warning devices must be unambiguous, easily perceived
      and easily understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warnings or warning devices may be appropriate where risks to health or
      safety remain after other hardware measures have been taken. They may be
      incorporated into systems of work (including permit-to-work systems), and
      can enforce measures of information, instruction and training.
    </p>
    <p>
      A warning is normally in the form of a notice or similar, for example:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          positive instructions (example, hard hats must be worn)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          prohibitions (example, not to be operated by people under 18 years)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          restrictions (example, do not heat above 60oC).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      A warning device is an active unit giving a visible or audible signal. It
      is often connected into equipment so that it is active only when a hazard
      exists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visual warnings will be effective only if a person frequently looks in a
      particular direction, and therefore may not be as widely applicable as
      audible signals. Appropriate choice of colour and flashing can catch
      attention, and also reinforce the warning nature of a visual signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audible signals should be of such a type that people unambiguously
      perceive it as a warning. It must also be possible to distinguish between
      the warnings given by separate warning devices and between the warnings
      and any other, unrelated, signals which may be in operation at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may not be possible to rely on audible signals in a noisy environment,
      nor in circumstances where many such signals are expected to be active at
      one time.
