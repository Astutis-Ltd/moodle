    <p>
      One of the original researchers, Karlene Roberts
      <span class="ast-bold">(1990)</span> suggested that to identify a HRO it
      was necessary to ask the question:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        How often could this organisation have failed with dramatic
        consequences? If the answer to this question is many thousands of times
        the organisation is highly reliable….(and)….performance reliability
        matches productivity as a dominant goal.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      Another, La Porte (1996) suggested that HRO’s are ‘hazardous systems’ that
      produce ‘nearly accident-free performance’ or ‘function in a nearly error
      free fashion’
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem with these definitions is in identifying the tipping points
      that determine whether an organisation has high, ordinary or low
      reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The statistics offered in support of the view that the three organisations
      demonstrated a higher level of reliability than organisations engaged in
      other activities has been challenged successfully at many levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a consequence of these difficulties in defining HRO’s Rochlin
      <span class="ast-bold">(1993)</span>
      noted that:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        There is therefore, no a priori way to evaluate… the mathematical or
        statistical performance of the organisation… relative to any theoretical
        optimal condition
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      Rochlin then turned his attention to defining HRO’s through the presence
      of key features which he determined to be:

      This technological approach seemed to preclude many high hazard workplaces
      such as railways and the oil and gas sector from being considered as HRO’s
      as the technology and systems were not deemed to be sufficiently complex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weick and Sutcliffe <span class="ast-bold">(2001)</span> determined that a
      more useful way of defining organisations was by focussing on the way the
      organisation goes about its business, the way it
      <span class="ast-italic">‘thinks and acts’</span> thus reconceptualising
      HRO’s as <span class="ast-italic">‘mindful organisations’.</span> This may
      be seen to be useful as it moves the discussion away from outcome (How
      safe does an organisation have to be, to be an HRO?) to process (What does
      an organisation need to be doing to achieve its desired goal?).
    </p>
    <p>
      Weick and Sutcliffe boiled down the findings from the HRO literature into
      the following five key characteristics, which are held to produce a
      collective state of <spana class="ast-italic">‘mindfulness’.</spana>

    <p>
      Weick’s research clearly positions a HRO not only as a mindful
      organisation, but also as a learning organisation, clearly overlapping
      with safety culture research in the process. Weick also suggested that
      being an HRO is not an
      <span class="ast-italic">‘all or nothing’</span> concept but that the more
      of these characteristics an organisation embodies the closer it gets to
      the ideal.
