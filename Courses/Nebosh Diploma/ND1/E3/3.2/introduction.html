      The term
      <span class="ast-italic">“high reliability organisation”</span> (HRO)
      evolved from research countering Perrow’s work on Normal Accident Theory
      after the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear plant incident which implied that
      accidents happen and failures are inevitable in complex high-hazard
      organisations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1984 the Berkeley
      <span class="ast-italic">‘High Reliability Organisations’</span> project
      began when Todd La Porte from the Political Science Department, Karlene
      Roberts from the Business School, and Gene Rochlin from the Energy and
      Resources Group at the University of California, Berkeley Campus, came
      together to explore their common interest in studying organisations that
      were effectively managing intrinsically hazardous, technically complex
      systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each had come to the to the same perspective from their different academic
      disciplines that the time and effort spent on researching organisational
      failure was not being matched by research into organisations that were
      operating safely and reliably in similarly challenging circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using existing contacts, the group was able to pull together leaders,
      managers and supervisors from air traffic control, a nuclear power station
      and a US navy nuclear aircraft carrier for a number of joint workshops to
      investigate commonalities of approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast majority of literature on HRO’s is derived from this original
      research.
