        What can other organisations learn from HRO’s?<br />
      </h2>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      Clearly much of what has been discussed here can be seen as good health
      and safety management and as features of organisations with a positive
      health and safety culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as discussed, most of the research into HRO’s has been
      qualitative, typically employing a case study-based approach. This
      approach has provided rich descriptions and understandings of HRO
      processes in very specific contexts but has not provided a clear
      theoretical framework that would help explain why and how HROs are able to
      operate and sustain high levels of operational efficiency and reliability
      where others would fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lack of an explanatory framework to show the underlying mechanisms
      that enable HROs to successfully maintain high levels of safety
      performance limits the ability to apply those mechanisms to other
      organisations.
    </p>
    <p>
      HRO theory and research has also been criticised due to the small range of
      ‘exotic’ organisations that have been studied and because of
      incompatibilities with research carried out in other ‘unpredictable’
      organisational contexts, for example healthcare research has shown that
      effective anticipation and prevention of errors in real time is not always
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a lack of empirical research to show the extent to which HRO
      processes are transferable to more general organisational contexts and it
      is therefore possible that HRO processes that are effective in some
      contexts may be ineffective or even detrimental in others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another, more practical, consideration is whether or not a cost benefit
      analysis would justify HRO levels of investment in engineering, management
      systems and human resources in lower risk, mainstream organisations.
    </p>
    <p>
      There have been several attempts to apply HRO principles and reliability
      enhancing practices in healthcare settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roberts et al. (2005) introduced HRO processes in a children’s medical
      centre which included: having several clinical staff check on a patient’s
      health (redundancy); provision of training for clinical staff to increase
      their awareness of how things could go wrong (culture of continuous
      learning); and enabling the best qualified staff to make decisions in in
      emergencies and patient care planning (deference to expertise).
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast Tamuz and Harrison (2006) argued that some HRO principles were
      ineffective or counter-productive in certain contexts, for example the
      double-checking of hazardous medication, a form of redundancy that is
      widely used in nursing. Excessive reliance on double-checking was seen to
      undermine safety critical tasks by breeding a culture of complacency or a
      sense of diffusion of responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankel, Leonard, and Denham (2006) discussed the importance of open
      communication in helping healthcare organisations become more reliable
      arguing that the dominant ethos / mentality in hospital operating theatres
      is the expectation that staff are ‘experts’ and infallible which does not
      foster an environment where more junior staff can openly raise concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
      A final consideration is that reliability is not always synonymous with
      safety. In the original research much of the discussion of the reliability
      of the nuclear power station and electricity distribution network related
      to the reliability of power supply. Subsequent research challenged this
      noting the potential conflict between reliability of supply and safety,
      and that the one was not necessarily a good indicator of the other.
