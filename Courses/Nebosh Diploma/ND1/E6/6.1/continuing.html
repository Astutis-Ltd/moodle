    <p>
      Notions of learning through reflection on past experience as an aid to
      personal continuous improvement are now common in many professions,
      notably those in education and medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuing professional development (CPD) is the term that describes a
      commitment to structured skills enhancement and professional competence.
      Commitment to CPD also acknowledges that becoming qualified is merely the
      beginning of the professional journey and that lifelong learning is
      essential to maintain professional standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      CPD provides a framework for keeping up to date in a rapidly evolving
      professional landscape and addressing the challenges and opportunities of
      global competition, technological advances and increasingly demanding
      clients. The ability to recognise and adapt to the changing landscape
      faster than the competition provides a source of sustainable competitive
      advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The IOSH CPD scheme provides a planned and structured approach for
      identifying technical and personal skill gaps, and creating an action plan
      to refresh or expand knowledge and enhance professional effectiveness. It
      is intended to enhance professional effectiveness, create a structured
      career path and safeguard professional status.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping up to date and recording the development activities is a
      requirement of the IOSH membership structure. Becoming a

      or <span class="ast-bold">technician member</span> enhances professional
      status and comes with the responsibility of demonstrating continuing
      professional development.
