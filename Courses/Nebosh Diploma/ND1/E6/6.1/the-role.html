    <p>
      It is impossible to come up with a one size fits all definition or job
      description to explain what a health and safety professional is or does,
      as this will clearly vary with organisational complexity, the hazard
      burden and risk profile of the organisation and the individuals position
      in the management structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is clear though is that health and safety is everyone’s
      responsibility and should be managed through general line management
      arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The IOSH competence framework suggests that the health and safety
      professional’s role is to apply their technical, behavioural and
      management abilities to work collaboratively with stakeholders to build an
      organisational structure, plan activities, assign responsibilities,
      develop safe working practices and implement management procedures that
      will help keep colleagues and others healthy and safe at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will involve advising, coaching, mentoring and supporting colleagues
      from the leadership team, line management and operational workforce as
      well as monitoring, reviewing and feeding back on the work that is being
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a manager in an organisation the health and safety professional may
      well also have responsibilities to protect their employer from litigation
      and reputational damage etc which together with pressures to not slow down
      production or service delivery can lead to professional ethical conflict.
