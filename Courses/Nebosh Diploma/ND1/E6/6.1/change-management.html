      Where organisational changes affect the way work is done, throughout the
      change and/or after the change the risk assessments for the affected work
      will require review and possible revision. The health and safety
      professional(s) should be consulted early on the possible impacts the
      changes will have on health and safety and be involved in the change
      management project to ensure that health and safety risks are properly
      managed throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Plan, Do, Check, Act management control cycle offers a useful
      structure for planning and implementing a change and for reviewing the
      effectiveness of the change and driving any necessary further actions.
