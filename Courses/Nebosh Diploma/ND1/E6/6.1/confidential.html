      The Data Protection Act 2018 implements the EU’s General Data Protection
      Regulation (GDPR) in the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone responsible for using personal data (i.e. information that
      relates to an identified or identifiable natural person) has to follow
      strict rules called ‘data protection principles’ and must make sure the
      information is:

      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">

          used fairly, lawfully and transparently
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          used for specified, explicit purposes
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          used in a way that is adequate, relevant and limited to only what is
          necessary
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          kept for no longer than is necessary
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          handled in a way that ensures appropriate security, including
          protection against unlawful or unauthorised processing, access, loss,
          destruction or damage.

    <p>
      There is stronger legal protection for more sensitive information about
      race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, political affiliations, religious
      belief and genetic and biometric information.
    </p>
    <p>
      In health and safety management information on trade union membership and
      health surveillance information falls into the ‘sensitive information’
      category.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal data in incident investigation reports should be removed or
      restricted before any report is circulated within the organisation or
      shared with an insurer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is clear “lawful basis” for managing personal data within a health
      and safety management system, notably legal obligations to keep training
      records, health surveillance records etc, and a legitimate interest in
      properly ensuring the health and safety of those employed by the
      organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data protection principles must be followed to ensure that the
      information is stored securely, used appropriately and kept for no longer
      than necessary.
