    <p>
      Conflict of interest refers to occasions where using professional judgment
      may lead to problems in securing future or continuing employment or
      contracts.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple example of this type of conflict might be where a consultant is
      aware that his recommendations are not being implemented but continues to
      advise the organisation so as not to lose the income from the contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      The IOSH code of conduct requires members to seek to avoid their
      professional judgment being influenced by any conflict of interest and to
      inform their employer, client, or the Institution of any conflict between
      personal interest and service to the relevant party.
