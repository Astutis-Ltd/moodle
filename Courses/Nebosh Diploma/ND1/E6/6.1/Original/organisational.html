        Organisational context and health and<br />safety responsibilities<br />

    <p>
      ISO45001 requires organisations to determine the external and internal
      issues that are relevant to its purpose and that may affect its ability to
      achieve the intended outcome(s) of the management system. This includes
      determining the relevant needs and expectations of workers and any other
      stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      This context is typically determined through a SWOT analysis to understand
      opportunities and threats in the operating environment and current
      strengths and weaknesses within the organisation. A PESTLE analysis
      provides further information on external variables that may impact upon
      the organisation and the way it works.
    </p>
    <p>
      A high-level understanding of the key internal and external issues that
      can positively or negatively affect health and safety within the
      organisation and how they interact is essential before planning and
      implementing controls within the system.
