    <p>
      The risk profile of an organisation informs all aspects of the approach to
      leading and managing its health and safety risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The risk profile is the starting point for determining the greatest health
      and safety issues facing the organisation. In some businesses the risks
      will be tangible and immediate safety hazards, whereas in other
      organisations the risks may be health-related and it may be a long time
      before the illness becomes apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The range of risks goes beyond health and safety risks to include quality,
      environmental and asset damage, recognising that issues in one area could
      impact in another.

    <p>
      Health and safety risks range from things that happen very infrequently
      but with catastrophic effects (high-hazard, low-frequency events, such as
      an oil refinery explosion) to things that happen much more frequently but
      with lesser consequences (low-hazard, high-frequency events such as slips
      and trips).
    </p>
    <p>
      High-hazard, low-frequency events are high-priority in a risk profile, as
      the consequences are potentially catastrophic and could compromise the
      organisation’s ability to function or survive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outcome of risk profiling will be that the significant risks have been
      identified and prioritised for action, and minor risks will not have been
      given too much priority. It also informs decisions about what risk control
      measures are needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risk profiling provides important management information at board or
      senior management level to determine organisational priorities,
      appropriate allocation of resources, etc. At this level health and safety
      information is considered holistically with other organisational /
      enterprise risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note the distinction between organisational risk profiling providing high
      level management information for strategic planning, and operational risk
      management dealing with local problems to ensure the effective management
      of risks to health and safety, so far as is reasonably practicable.
