    <p>
      The safety practitioner will have a role to play as both manager in the
      organisation and leader for health and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      As manager the safety practitioner will have clearly defined role and
      responsibilities within the safety management system and can be held
      accountable if these responsibilities are not properly fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The management responsibilities in the context of the safety management
      system are discussed in the next section.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a leadership perspective the safety practitioner may well be the
      champion within the organisation, providing a vision, direction and
      strategy, and seeking to motivate and inspire others from board level down
      to operational staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      As has been discussed some people may have natural traits, aptitudes and
      charisma that predisposes them for a leadership role. Whether this is the
      case or not leadership can be understood and taught as a process, and
      regardless of preferences for particular theories at a personal or
      organisational level, ways can be found to lead initiatives successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      As discussed earlier in this section reflective practice and personal
      continual improvement are required in any modern professional role. It is
      important after every initiative to take the time to reflect on successes
      and failures and to take the opportunity to learn, improve and modify
      approaches ahead of next time.
