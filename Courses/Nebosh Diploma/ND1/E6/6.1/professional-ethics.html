    <p>
      Ethics may be considered to be the science, or systematic analysis, of
      morality where morality implies the codes of conduct or rules of behaviour
      imposed by a society regarding what is right and wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professional bodies, such as IOSH, issue codes of conduct to frame the
      expected standard of professional practice with regard to technical
      competence, as previously discussed, and professional conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      IOSH’s code of conduct is a public document that has at its heart the IOSH
      vision of ‘a world of work which is safe, healthy and sustainable’.
    </p>
    <p>It is divided into three parts:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">Part 1 – Code of conduct</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Part 2 – Code of conduct – guidance
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Part 3 – IOSH disciplinary procedure.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>It is intended to:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          provide a strong ethical foundation for all members working towards
          the IOSH vision
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          help members demonstrate their value and reliability through adhering
          to high standards.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The guidance is designed to support members’ efforts to reach and maintain
      the standards, which are expressed as four core values of integrity,
      competence, respect and service (see the below table).
    </p>
    <p>The standards are based on public expectations of professionalism.</p>
    <p>
      Members owe a primary loyalty to those at risk and should seek to ensure
      professional independence in the execution of their duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members must also avoid departing from the standards of integrity,
      competence and respect in their private lives in any way that could
      undermine public trust and confidence in the profession.
