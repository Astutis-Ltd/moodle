    <p>
      Competence is generally defined as the ability to perform to a required
      standard, and a person is regarded as competent when they have sufficient
      training and experience or knowledge and other qualities to be able to
      properly assist in undertaking the measures referred to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professional competence must be obtained, maintained and developed by
      taking all reasonable steps to keep up to date with new developments in
      occupational safety and health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acknowledgement of the limitations of personal competence is an important
      part of the process. Proper preparation and / or appropriate
      qualifications may be essential in assuring competence for a specific
      activity.
