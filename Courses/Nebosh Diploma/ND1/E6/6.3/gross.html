    <p>
      A control measure is not reasonably practicable if its costs are grossly
      disproportionate to the benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the costs of a control measure are greater than the benefits there is
      disproportion. Whether or not the degree of disproportion is ‘gross’ is a
      judgement that must be made on a case by case basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no authoritative guidance from the Courts as to what factors
      should be taken into account in determining whether or not the costs are
      grossly disproportionate. The HSE tends to use a ‘rule of thumb’ that a
      factor of up to 3 (i.e. costs 3 times larger than benefits) would apply
      for risks to workers, for low risks to members of the public a factor of
      2, and for high risks a factor of 10).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is generally accepted that the GDF should be higher when the risks are
      close to the maximum tolerable level and lower when the risks are close to
      the broadly acceptable level. (Tolerability of risk in
      <span class="ast-bold">Element 4</span>).
    </p>
    <p>The consideration can be expressed as the following equation:</p>

    <div style="display: flex">
      <p>If</p>
      <div style="margin: 0 5px; text-align: center">
        <p style="margin: 0">Costs</p>
        <div
          style="
            height: 1px;
            width: 100%;
            background-color: black;
            margin: 5px 0;
          "
        ></div>
        <p style="margin: 0">Benefits</p>
      </div>
      <p style="white-space: nowrap">> 1 x GDF then &nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin: 0">
        costs are grossly disproportionate to the benefits and the measure can
        be considered not worth doing for the risk reduction achieved.
      </p>
    </div>
