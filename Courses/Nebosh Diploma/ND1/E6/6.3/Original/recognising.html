    <p>
      Health and safety may be considered a ‘cost of doing business’ as the
      employing organisation has to comply with the law and keep employees and
      others safe, in which case the budget for providing any necessary
      equipment, PPE and training should be held by the local department or cost
      centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larger organisations may well have a dedicated ‘health and safety’ budget
      but this is likely to be for the salary and overhead costs for the safety
      practioner(s), administration of the safety management system, maintenance
      of accreditations, certifications, etc. There may also be a contingency
      fund earmarked for dealing with the consequences of a significant
      accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many organisations may use a ‘business partner’ model for support services
      ancillary to production or service delivery (HR, IT, H&amp;S, etc.) with
      individual departments paying an internal levy to cover the cost of the
      service. This is based on the generally accepted premise that health and
      safety management is an operational line management function with the
      health and safety practitioner providing a professional advice and support
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The budget for maintenance of the structural fabric of the workplace,
      utilities, telecommunications infrastructure, grounds maintenance,
      catering and security services, etc, may well be held by a facilities
      management department, or contracts manager if contracted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Budget holders need to be clear on their responsibilities and
      accountabilities as both line managers and budget holders.
