    <br />
    <p>
      Annualisation is the process of determining the average cost and the
      average benefit per year. It is done by summing up all discounted costs
      and all discounted benefits over the appraisal period and by dividing the
      outcomes by the length of the appraisal period.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, the annual cost will be smaller than the actual cost in the
      first year and larger than the actual cost in subsequent years. The annual
      benefit will generally be of similar magnitude of the actual benefit
      accruing each year.
