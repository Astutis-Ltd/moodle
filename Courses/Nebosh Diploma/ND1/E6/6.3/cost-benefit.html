      <p>Cost benefit analysis (CBA)</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Cost benefit analysis (CBA) is a defined methodology for valuing costs and
      benefits that enables broad comparisons to be made between different
      investment options. All costs and benefits are quantified in cash terms
      and the benefit-cost-ratio (BCR) of each option can be calculated and
      compared thus enabling informed decisions to be made on the basis of a
      consistent, transparent process.
    </p>
    <p>
      CBA may be undertaken in support of general commercial decisions or
      specifically in the health and safety context to help to determine whether
      or not a particular risk control measure is necessary to ensure safety so
      far as is reasonably practicable (SFAIRP), or to reduce a level of risk as
      low as is reasonably practicable (ALARP).
    </p>
    <p>
      Cases such as the Ford Motor Company decision to go to market with the
      Ford Pinto in 1970 show the danger of making a decision purely on the
      basis of CBA. Having failed low speed impact tests the Pinto was known to
      have a problem with its petrol tank design that could have been addressed
      for $11 per vehicle but would have significantly delayed the launch date.
      Ford decided to launch without making the improvement knowing that
      collisions would result in fuel leaks, fires and explosions. Between 1971
      and 1978, the Pinto was responsible for a number of fire-related deaths.
      Ford put the figure at 23 but other estimates suggest the figure was
      closer to 500.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1973, Ford’s Environmental and Safety Engineering division submitted a
      cost-benefit analysis entitled
      <span class="ast-bold"
        >Fatalities Associated with Crash Induced Fuel Leakage and Fires</span
      >
      for submission to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
      (NHTSA) in support of Ford’s objection to proposed stronger fuel system
      regulation. The analysis compared the cost of repairs to the societal
      costs for injuries and deaths related to fires in cases of vehicle roll
      overs for all cars sold in the US by all manufacturers. Ford estimated the
      cost of fuel system modifications to reduce fire risks in roll over events
      to be $11 per car across 12.5 million cars and light trucks (all
      manufacturers), for a total of $137 million. The design changes were
      estimated to save 180 burn deaths and 180 serious injuries per year, a
      cost to society of $49.5 million.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the costs of improvement were more than 2.75 times greater than the
      societal benefits, it was used to argue against making the fuel system
      modifications.

      <p>CBA and health and safety risk controls</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      In the context of health and safety risk controls the point of the
      exercise is to inform a decision on whether or not a control measure is
      proprtionate to the risk (constitutes sensible risk management) or not (as
      per the Court of Appeal decision in Edwards v NCB 1949). Commercial
      considerations such as ability to pay are not directly relevant.

      <p>
        'Reasonably practicable’ is a narrower term than ‘physically possible’ …
        a computation must be made by the owner in which the quantum of risk is
        placed on one scale and the sacrifice involved in the measures necessary
        for averting the risk (whether in money, time or trouble) is placed on
        the other, and that, if it be shown that there is a gross disproportion
        between them - the risk being insignificant in relation to the sacrifice
        - the defendants discharge the onus on them.

      The HSE has produced guidance on the correct use of CBA as part of as low

      <span class="ast-bold">Note:</span> Re-instatement costs may need to be
      treated as a benefit rather than offsetting them against costs. This would
      be the case if the plant being re-instated were a safety-related plant
      (e.g. one that treats hazardous waste). This can represent a bias in
      favour of safety as the gross disproportion factor is applied to all
      benefits prior to them being compared to the costs.
