      A commercial budget is the financial expression of an agreed business plan
      for a given future period. It translates the organisation’s long-term
      objectives into short term operating plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan should clearly express the level of activity (revenue generation)
      and expenditure necessary to implement the plan and deliver on the
      principal objectives of the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      To survive, let alone thrive, the organisation needs to generate a net
      profit by earning more than it spends. It also needs to manage cash flow
      to ensure that spending money is available when required for paying
      salaries, rent, utilities bills and other business critical expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The budget is a modelled forecast of what is expected to happen based on
      as much accurate management information as possible including:

    <p>
      Operational or trading budgets are normally prepared in advance of and for
      a trading year, and then broken down into shorter operational periods,
      e.g. months or quarters, so that progress against the budget can be
      evaluated. Outline budgets may be prepared for three or five years ahead
      but forecasting this far in advance is much less reliable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research and Development (R&D) budgets and capital expenditure (Capex)
      budgets may cover much longer time periods. Ten year plans are not unusual
      in these contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Financial Director / Chief Finance Officer (FD / CFO) will prepare a
      draft budget for the organisation as a whole, starting with a sales
      forecast which indicates the level of expected activity and revenue
      generation. This will then be broken down into budgets for individual
      departments or cost centres which will be negotiated with the responsible
      managers and agreed as being realistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The budget should model expected cash-flow, profit and loss, and a balance
      sheet with total assets and liabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      A budget should not be a ‘financial strait-jacket’ but it should provide a
      ‘navigation chart’ to keep the business on course to achieve its
      objectives and to define individual responsibilities and accountabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Budgetary control requires a frequent (e.g. monthly) comparison between
      the budget and the actual results and an analysis of the differences
      between the two. The comparison serves two purposes:

          To investigate the reasons for the differences so that corrective
          action can be taken to increase activity, reduce expenditure, and
          increase profit
