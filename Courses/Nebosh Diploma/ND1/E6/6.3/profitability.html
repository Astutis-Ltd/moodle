    <p>A net profit needs to be judged in two contexts:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          against the sales revenue that generated it (i.e. £10 000 profit from
          £100 000 of sales indicates a 10% profit which might be reasonable)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          against the capital employed to achieve it (the same £10 000 profit
          after a £1 000 000 investment seems a very poor result).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Generally the higher the profit is as a proportion of either figure the
      better, though the comparison with capital employed is theoretically the
      better indicator. This calculation is termed the ‘Return on Investment’
      (ROI) or ‘Return on Capital Employed’ (ROCE).

    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Capital budgeting</span> is the process by which a
      business determines and evaluates potential large scale potential
      investments (capital expenditure or capex). There are a number of tools
      that can be used to evaluate the feasibility of a particular investment,
      notably payback analysis and net present value calculations.

      <p>Payback analysis</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Payback analysis can be used to calculate the payback period which is the
      length of time required to recover the cost of an investment, i.e. an
      investment of £30 000 that generates £10 000 per year has a payback period
      of three years. The weaknesses of the payback period as an indicator of an
      acceptable investment are:

          It does not consider the Time Value of Money (TVM), i.e. the idea that
          an amount of cash in hand today is worth more than the same money at
          some point in the future as it can be invested and make more money in
          the meantime
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          It ignores any future contributions made after the payback period.

      <p>Net Present Value (NPV)</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The NPV is the most accurate and theoretically correct method of
      evaluating an investment as it recognises that the further in the future
      funds are due to be received the greater the uncertainty (risk) that it
      will be received and the greater the loss of opportunity to use those
      funds (opportunity costs). Accordingly, future cash flows are discounted
      more steeply relative to the riskiness of the investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Future value tables or computer programmes are used to calculate the
      appropriate discounts.
