    <p>
      A ‘conflict situation’ is one in which the concerns of two people appear
      to be incompatible. This may occur where individual objectives have not
      been aligned holistically with the organisation’s objectives putting
      colleagues in a position where they are competing for common resources.
    </p>
    <p>Examples might include:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          a production manager not wanting production down time for maintenance
          activities bringing conflict with the maintenance manager, or
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the learning and development manager and health and safety manager
          requiring operational staff to attend a training course and the
          production manager feeling unable to spare the staff from production
          duties.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Influencing skills through consultation, persuasion and negotiation are
      important but in addition to the logical aspects of the dialogue, the
      personality types of the stakeholders will also be a factor and may
      predispose the parties to behave to type.

    <p>
      It is important to be professional, unemotional and respectful of the
      other parties position at all times. If the issue cannot be resolved
      through the use of authority or legitimate position power (i.e. in the
      management system the claim of one party clearly takes priority over the
      other) or persuasion, there may be a need to defer to a higher power for
      mediation and resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these situations it is important that the lessons are learned at an
      organisational level and systems are adapted or clarified to remove the
      opportunity for similar future conflict.
