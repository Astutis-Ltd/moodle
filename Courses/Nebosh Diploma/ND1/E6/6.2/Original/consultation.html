        Consultation and negotiation when developing<br />an organisation’s

    <p>
      The organisation’s headline priorities and objectives for health and
      safety are determined through risk profiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the headline objectives are understood these will need to be cascaded
      down through the organisation leading to objectives at the divisional,
      departmental, team and individual levels.

        <strong> Negotiation</strong> – listening to the needs of the other
        party and coming to a mutually satisfactory resolution.
      </div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <p>
      Each operational area of the organisation will have different hazard
      burdens and different operational health and safety challenges to address
      and different perceived priorities which can lead to competition for
      priority and the corresponding budget and resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Consultation</strong> with all stakeholders and the open sharing
      of information and views will play an important part in the process of
      determining the organisations health and safety objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Influencing skills</strong> (i.e. persuasion and negotiation) will
      also be important in overcoming any conflict between the stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The logical presentation of the organisation’s needs, based on sensible
      health and safety risk management and a holistic view of the
      organisational impact of alternative action plans, should help to persuade
      the stakeholders of the need to act for the greater good.
    </p>
    <p>
      The art of effective negotiation is to engineer a situation where both
      parties believe they have gained something from the process (the
      ‘win-win’) without having suffered unacceptable losses to do so. It is
      important therefore to enter a negotiation with a clear objective
      (understanding of what the ‘win’ looks like) together with a view of what
      can be comfortably traded (acceptable losses / compromises) to achieve it.
