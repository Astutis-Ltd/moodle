    <br />
    <p>
      ACAS considers employee consultation to be about involving and developing
      people in an organisation. For an organisation to be effective it must

      With current management trends favouring flatter structures and the
      devolvement of responsibilities to individuals, it is increasingly
      important that employees have a real understanding not only of<strong>

      >
      they are required to do but <strong>why</strong>.

      there can be many benefits that can clearly outweigh the costs. The
      benefits to the organisation may include:
