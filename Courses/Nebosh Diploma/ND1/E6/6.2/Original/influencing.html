        Influencing ownership of health and <br />safety at all organisational

      </h2>

    <br />
    <p>
      In an organisation with a positive health and safety culture the
      importance of good health and safety management will be understood and
      valued throughout the organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At board level the MD / CEO or an appointed champion must be seen to be
      driving the agenda and leading from the front. Other board members should
      also be seen to have ‘bought in’ to health and safety and to present a
      united front.
    </p>
    <p>
      The safety practitioner may have a significant role in presenting the
      professional evidence to persuade the leadership team of the importance of
      the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Line managers may also need to be convinced to play their part effectively
      and the safety practitioner will have a role to play in peer to peer
      persuasion and negotiation and in providing technical support to enable
      line managers to take responsibility locally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Operational staff also need to be engaged and again the safety
      practitioner will have a key role to play in devising, implementing and
      supporting means of providing information and consulting with employees
      directly, or with their representatives, to enable workforce participation
      in operational health and safety management.
    </p>
