      The organisation’s headline priorities and objectives for health and
      safety are determined through risk profiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the headline objectives are understood these will need to be cascaded
      down through the organisation leading to objectives at the divisional,
      departmental, team and individual levels.

          Each operational area of the organisation will have different hazard
          burdens and different operational health and safety challenges to
          address and different perceived priorities which can lead to
          competition for priority and the corresponding budget and resources.

      <span class="ast-bold">Influencing skills</span> (i.e. persuasion and
      negotiation) will also be important in overcoming any conflict between the
      stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The logical presentation of the organisation’s needs, based on sensible
      health and safety risk management and a holistic view of the
      organisational impact of alternative action plans, should help to persuade
      the stakeholders of the need to act for the greater good.
    </p>
    <p>
      The art of effective negotiation is to engineer a situation where both
      parties believe they have gained something from the process (the
      ‘win-win’) without having suffered unacceptable losses to do so. It is
      important therefore to enter a negotiation with a clear objective
      (understanding of what the ‘win’ looks like) together with a view of what
      can be comfortably traded (acceptable losses / compromises) to achieve it.
