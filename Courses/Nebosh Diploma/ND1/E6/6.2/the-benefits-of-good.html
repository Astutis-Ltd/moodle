    <p>
      ACAS considers employee consultation to be about involving and developing
      people in an organisation. For an organisation to be effective it must
      achieve its goals and this can only be done by individuals and groups
      within the organisation cooperating and working together in a coordinated
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good consultation and communication are essential in encouraging employee
      cooperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the size of the organisation, and regardless of whether or not it
      is trade unionised, employees will only be able to perform at their best
      if they:

      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          have an opportunity of making their views known to management on the
          issues that affect them.

    <p>
      With current management trends favouring flatter structures and the
      devolvement of responsibilities to individuals, it is increasingly
      important that employees have a real understanding not only of
      <span class="ast-bold">what</span> they are required to do but
      <span class="ast-bold">why</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effective consultation requires resources including time and money but
      there can be many benefits that can clearly outweigh the costs. The
      benefits to the organisation may include:

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">Improved organisational performance.</span>
          Time spent consulting at the outset of a new project or development
          can minimise subsequent rumour and misunderstanding

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

          >
          Employee input can help managers arrive at sound decisions which are
          more readily accepted by employees as a whole
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">Greater levels of trust</span> and improved
          management / employee relations as a consequence of giving employees
          the opportunity to express their views and discuss issues of common
          interest
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">Improved employee engagement.</span> ‘Positive
          discretionary behaviour’ (i.e. employees going the ‘extra mile’) is
          much more likely if employees feel valued and involved in
          decision-making
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold"
            >Improved employee commitment and performance.</span
          >
          Commitment is likely to be enhanced (together with trust and
          engagement) if employees know what the organisation is trying to
          achieve and how they, as individuals, can influence decisions.
          Performance is also likely to improve if employees are given regular,
          accurate information about their jobs including information on
          targets, deadlines and feedback
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">Increased job satisfaction</span> and better
          employee motivation are also likely if performance levels are high and
          the employees are engaged and trust management.
