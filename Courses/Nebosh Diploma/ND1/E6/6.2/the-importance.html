      A feedback loop is essential in a self-regulating system, such as an
      organisation, because evaluating output (performance) against expectation
      provides management information that can be used to refine processes and
      adjust required resources (inputs) to drive continual improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The influence of the feedback loop on individual behaviour has been shown
      to be critical in encouraging repetition of positive behaviour and
      discouraging negative behaviours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many components of the health and safety management system will rely upon
      the contribution of engaged workers, e.g. hazard spotting, risk
      assessments, incident reporting, accident investigation and workplace
      inspections. It is vitally important that contributors receive early
      regular feedback on their contributions, to know that their efforts are
      worthwhile and appreciated and to sustain both the individual efforts and
      the functioning of the systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also important that the safety practitioner receives feedback on
      their personal contribution through performance reviews and 360-degree
      appraisals, etc. This information should be used to drive personal
      continual improvement / Continual Professional Development (CPD).
