    <p>
      Following a major accident, it is imperative that the organisation and its
      leadership takes responsibility and provides accurate information to
      interested stakeholders in a timely manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this does not happen the resulting ‘information vacuum’ will be filled
      by the media from other sources and those directly and indirectly affected
      by the event start to consider the media as the primary source of
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrangements should be in place for requests for information to be managed
      through a central communications team which will be responsible for
      issuing press releases and several members of the senior leadership team
      including the CEO/MD should be trained in how to deal with journalist
      interviews for television, radio or newsprint / online.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a difficult balance to be struck between taking responsibility,
      focussing on the human costs and the needs of affected families etc whilst
      looking to preserve the organisations reputation and looking to manage
      legal consequences.
