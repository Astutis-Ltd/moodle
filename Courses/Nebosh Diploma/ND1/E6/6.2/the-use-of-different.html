    <p>
      The communication process can be thought of as a cycle, involving the
      message sender and the message receiver. At each stage there are potential
      barriers to effective communication.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <span class="ast-bold">message sender</span> may not understand the
      subject matter well enough to be able to properly encode the message. The
      language may be inappropriate (too much jargon) or the pitch may be too
      complicated or too simplistic for the audience.
    </p>
    <p>The <span class="ast-bold">communication channel</span> may be:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          unsuitable, e.g. trying to explain a complex process through written
          description only when a pictorial approach would be simpler
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          compromised, e.g. technical failures of telephone systems or email
          servers, or background noise interrupting face to face conversation.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The <span class="ast-bold">message receiver</span> may not be able to
      properly decode the message because of unfamiliarity with the subject
      matter or technical jargon, disability or illness, impairment through
      drugs or alcohol, or the wearing of personal protective equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="ast-bold">feedback</span> is subject to the same
      challenges as the original message with regard to communication channels.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->

    <!--H4 Heading End-->
    <p>
      This may be direct (face to face), or indirect. Indirect verbal
      communication may involve sight of the message receiver (e.g. video
      conferencing) or may not (e.g. telephone call).
    </p>
    <p>
      A great deal of direct communication is through non-verbal cues or body
      language. This is lost with a telephone call.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merits of verbal communication are that it is immediate and provides
      an immediate opportunity for feedback and clarification. The limitations
      are that there is no tangible information for future reference, or
      evidence.
    </p>

    <!--H4 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h4">
      <p>Written communication</p>
    </div>
    <!--H4 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Historically the major limitation of written communication (traditional
      letters and internal memos) was the delay between stages of the process.
      Email has largely addressed this issue but has its own limitations, e.g.
      circulating to too wide an audience so that ownership of the action is
      lost, and getting an appropriate, business formal tone to the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Written communication allows for complex messages to be conveyed and
      recorded, providing the reader with an opportunity to reflect on and
      revisit the message before determining the next course of action. With
      modern software applications it is easy to include complex diagrams and
      photographs within written reports.
    </p>
    <p>Literacy levels can be a major barrier to written communication.</p>

    <!--H4 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h4">
      <p>Pictorial communication</p>
    </div>
    <!--H4 Heading End-->

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>A picture paints a thousand words</p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      The major limitation of pictorial communication is that without an
      explanation a picture is open to interpretation. The merits are that well
      designed safety signs, conforming to international standards, eliminate
      difficulties with language and literacy and convey a consistent message to
      an international workforce.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well as considering the most suitable medium for the type of message,
      consideration should be given to the preferences of the audience. When
      following driving directions some drivers like to follow a map, others
      prefer written step by step instructions, and others listen to verbal
      instructions from a portable route planner.
    </p>
    <p>
      With modern technology, using combinations of media for any given message
      is easier than ever.

    <p>
      Social media can enable communication, not only by providing a channel for
      information sharing but also by facilitating collaborative working,
      educating and entertaining. Social media sites may be classified by
      content, for example:

      Younger adults use social media as an integral part of their day to day
      life. The resources may be trusted more than messages received through
      official channels but conversely may not always be accurate. Older adults
      may be less engaged with social media and many people may not have access
      to the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HSE and IOSH both make lots of useful information available through a
      range of social media channels.

    <div class="ast-heading--h4">
      <p>The importance of using a variety of communication methods</p>
    </div>
    <!--H4 Heading End-->
    <p>
      In marketing terminology, communication that is aimed at influencing the
      attitude of a community toward some cause or position is termed
      <span class="ast-bold">propaganda,</span> and the media that is used to
      ‘sell’ the concept is termed
      <span class="ast-bold">collateral.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      No individual means of communication is going to be universally
      acceptable. Different people have different preferences. It is therefore
      essential that a range of methods and media (routes to market) are
      deployed to ensure that the messages are received and understood by as
      many of the target audience as possible in a timely manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different methods can also help to maintain interest in ongoing issues and
      reinforce messages that have been previously communicated.
    </p>
    <p>Issues to consider include:</p>
