      Health and safety professionals should play a leading role in stakeholder
      engagement, including collaborative working to build business benefit at
      whatever level they operate. Developing networks inside and outside of the
      business is essential in building and maintaining positive relationships
      to add strategic benefit to the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      As discussed earlier ISO45001 requires organisations to understand the
      external and internal issues that may affect the organisations operations,
      including the needs and expectations of workers and other stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this context, health and safety professionals work collaboratively with
      stakeholders to build a robust organisational structure, assign
      responsibilities, plan activities, develop safe systems of work and
      implement management procedures.
