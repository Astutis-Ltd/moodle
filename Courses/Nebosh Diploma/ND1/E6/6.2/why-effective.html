    <p>
      The art of effective communication is getting the right message (in the
      right format), to the right audience at the right time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effective communication is vital in health and safety management to ensure
      that workers are fully informed of workplace hazards and risks, risk
      control measures and expected behaviours to keep themselves and others
      safe. It is equally important to ensure that lessons learned from
      incidents are shared locally and elsewhere in the organisation to prevent
      similar future incidents causing more harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The organisationâ€™s efforts on risk assessment and control must be
      communicated to the workforce who need to know what risks to their health
      and safety are present and what control measures are in place to protect
      them.
