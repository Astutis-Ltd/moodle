      ISO 45001 specifies that roles, responsibilities and accountabilities
      should be defined and allocated, to facilitate effective health and safety
      management, and that the details should be documented and communicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      HSG65 recommends clearly defined performance standards for workers at all
      levels associated with rewards for good performance and sanctions for
      unacceptably poor performance as an important aspect of ‘organising for
      health and safety’.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good performance standards link individual responsibilities to specific
      organisational outputs and specify how individuals will be held
      accountable for their responsibilities, including those for health and
      safety.
    </p>
    <p>Performance standards should clearly specify:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">Who is responsible for what</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          When the work should be completed by
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The standard of performance required.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Everyone in the organisation, from the board of directors through line
      management, to operational staff, and staff with specific health and
      safety responsibilities (including the safety practitioner), should be
      clear on their roles and responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>The safety practitioner may have a role to play in:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          ensuring that the information is easy to understand and readily
          available
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          monitoring and auditing the ongoing effectiveness of the system to
          check that staff at all levels are not only aware but are acting
          accordingly.
