    <p>
      Regardless of whether an organisation is subject to legislative
      requirements or is free to self-regulate, it will be essential for it to
      develop and implement its own internal rules and procedures. Rules and
      procedures will be devised at a local level to provide workers with a
      definitive set of parameters within which they must operate. Not only will
      such rules and procedures help to ensure greater standards of safety and
      quality, but they will also form the basis of disciplinary hearings in the
      event of a breach.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order for rules and procedures to be effective, the following must be
      true:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The rules and procedures must be relevant to the workplace and / or
          task
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">They must be kept up to date</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Adequate, appropriate levels of supervision must be in place to
          identify failures to follow the rules and ensure compliance
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The organisation must have the will to sanction any breaking of the
          rules.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      It is widely accepted that adopting a ‘blame culture’ is
      counter-productive to good and effective safety management. Furthermore,
      an over-abundance of rules and procedures is likely to be perceived by the
      workforce as excessive, the danger then being that they will fail to
      differentiate between those rules that serve a useful and important
      purpose in managing risks and those that are superfluous – the end result
      being that all rules are ignored. Such situations are likely to be
      characterised by a poor safety culture with increasing injury and illness
      rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might also be said that a true ‘no-blame’ culture is almost as
      ineffective – if workers are not held accountable when appropriate, there
      is the possibility that they will continue to violate rules in the
      knowledge that there will be no punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many organisations now adopt a ‘fair blame’ approach. This recognises that
      the first option is not to blame a worker when an incident occurs but
      that, should a worker be found to have violated a rule or procedure, then
      they can expect to be disciplined.
