      ‘Self-regulation’ refers to the principle that an organisation is able to
      set its own internal standards, rather than having standards imposed upon
      it from another, usually governmental, body. As already discussed, many
      jurisdictions have legislation in place that sets out the minimum
      standards of health and safety to be achieved. It might be argued that in
      an ideal world this would be unnecessary, since organisations would
      recognise the intrinsic value of managing health and safety without the
      need to be told by government to do so – in other words, that a
      self-regulatory approach is more effective than regulation by or from
      central government.
    </p>
    <p>
      To some extent, the ‘goal-setting’ system of health and safety legislation
      outlined in this chapter allows a degree of self-regulation, insofar as
      organisations have the flexibility to decide exactly what measures are
      appropriate for control of risk in their particular circumstances.
      However, this is not pure self-regulation, since the organisation will
      still have to conform to minimum standards that are set by government.
    </p>

      The following discussion uses the UK as its foundation, but similar
      arguments apply equally in other jurisdictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the UK, the Robens Report (which led to the creation of the Health and
      Safety at Work etc. Act 1974) advocated a goal-based approach to health
      and safety regulation and also expressed the need for a ‘more effectively
      self-regulating system’.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hoped at the time that this would grow out of an increased
      atmosphere of communication and co-operation between employer and
      employees, capitalising on the role of the Trade Unions. In reality, a
      hybrid approach developed in the UK with the HSE taking the lead in the
      publication of guidance and advice leaving much of industry in a position
      of following their lead rather than taking the initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approach has generally been successful with rates of workplace
      fatalities, injuries and illnesses decreasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The debate over the merits of self-regulation (and the broader issue of
      deregulation) over state regulation is part of a broader political and
      philosophical argument about the required levels of state involvement in,
      and regulation of, business activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1992 John Major’s government responded to ongoing calls from business
      and the Conservative Party to lift the burden on business by launching a
      ‘deregulation initiative aimed at removing unnecessary red tape from
      business.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Sainsbury was appointed to head up a central Deregulation Task Force
      overseeing eight Business Task Forces as part of the Cabinet Office. The
      government position at the time was that:
    </p>

      <p>
        A certain amount of regulation is essential, not least to ensure public
        safety and promote quality standards, but these benefits have to be
        weighed against the cost of enforcing regulation and complying with it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      The New Labour administration set up the Better Regulation Task Force in
      1997 ‘to advise the Government on action to ensure that regulation and its
      enforcement are proportionate, accountable, consistent, transparent and
      targeted’ (The Task Force became the Better Regulation Commission on 1
      January 2006).
    </p>
    <p>
      In October 1999, the task force published its interim report defining
      self-regulation as:
    </p>

        ...the means by which members of a profession, trade or commercial
        activity are bound by a mutually agreed set of rules which govern their
        relationship with the citizen, client or customer.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      It was argued that self-regulation carries numerous advantages including:

      The Lofstedt Review (2011) is the latest UK Government-commissioned review
      of health and safety regulation. Its purpose was to:

      It is also important to note the role of ISO management standards such as
      ISO 45001 as a framework for transnational private (self-)regulation and
      that ISO standards have evolved to the common annexe SL framework which is
      much more goal-setting and self-regulatory in approach.
