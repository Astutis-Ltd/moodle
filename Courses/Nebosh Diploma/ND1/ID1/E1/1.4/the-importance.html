    <p>
      In the modern world, more than at any time in history, there is direct
      access to an enormous range of information in a variety of sources. The
      media play a central role in producing and disseminating information
      around the globe, helping to inform and shape opinions worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The media’ is a term that is normally associated with news reporting. In
      the modern age, news is reported by use of conventional ‘print’ media in
      the form of newspapers, periodicals and magazines, and as broadcast media,
      the obvious examples being television and radio. The last 30 years has
      also seen the rapid rise of the Internet, which offers unparalleled access
      to information in a way not dreamt of a generation ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of print and broadcast media, newspapers and public service
      broadcasters such as the BBC will publicise stories that they consider to
      be in the public interest. Therefore, serious and catastrophic events,
      usually involving loss of life and large-scale destruction of property are
      regularly reported. Examples include the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear
      plant disasters, offshore disasters such as Piper Alpha and the Deepwater
      Horizon explosion, train crashes such as Paddington or Clapham,
      environmental disasters such as the Exxon Valdez, and a host of other
      equally serious events, many of which obtain worldwide publicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incidents do not always gain worldwide expose, however. Some, though
      serious, are not picked up by global news networks, but are reported
      locally in newspapers and on local radio and television stations. This
      local reporting can have a significant impact on a business. If an
      organisation has won an award for excellence in safety management, then
      such publicity is likely to have a positive effect. If there has been a
      serious incident, the opposite will be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Internet has been harnessed by health and safety organisations such as
      the UK’s Health and Safety Executive, which offers an extensive range of
      guidance and information. Until very recently, information had to be
      purchased and sent via the post as a hard copy, which was expensive and
      time-consuming. Today, the same information is free to download at the
      press of a button. It is therefore right to say that access to health and
      safety information has never been greater, which should enable
      organisations of all sizes to obtain the information that they need in
      order to address safety concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HSE and OSHA websites also carry information on those organisations
      that have been convicted of health and safety offences. This can help
      other organisations to evaluate their health and safety performance. The
      threat of being ‘named and shamed’ in such a public manner may also give
      organisations food for thought when it comes to deciding whether or not to
      develop and implement sound systems of safety management.
    </p>
    <p>
      One possible problem with media coverage, especially the print media, is
      that coverage of health and safety issues may be negative. In the UK, for
      example, a number of daily newspapers regularly feature stories of poor
      health and safety decision making, which are apt to cause resentment to
      the whole idea of safely managing risks and which may cause people to
      ignore genuine and necessary safety arrangements. Such stories embed
      themselves in the memories of the readership who could be forgiven for
      thinking that health and safety is unnecessarily bureaucratic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, successes in health and safety management seldom get the
      same level of popular press attention, and so it is left to organisations
      and professional health and safety bodies, such as IOSH, to advertise
      successes in the media.
