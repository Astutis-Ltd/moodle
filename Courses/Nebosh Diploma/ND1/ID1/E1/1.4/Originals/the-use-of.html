        The use of non-conformity to an accredited<br />health and safety
        standard as a form of<br />enforcement<br />
      </h2>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      From your International General Certificate or equivalent studies you are
      expected to be familiar with&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem"
        >the ILO-OSH and ISO45001 standards for health and safety management
        systems. </span
      ><span style="font-size: 1rem"
        >Both standards provide an organisation with a framework for managing
        health and safety risks while simultaneously offering external
        stakeholders a degree of confidence in an organisationâ€™s ability to
        manage those risks.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Certification to either of these systems demonstrates a good standard of
      safety management and can provide the holder with a competitive advantage.
      In many cases, certification is used as a baseline for the selection of
      business partners, so its loss clearly has the potential for a detrimental
      impact on an organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Performance measurement plays a significant role in both of these models.
      A range of techniques, both active and reactive, can be used to establish
      the level of compliance against the standard. Where performance
      measurement is conducted internally, identification of non- conformities
      will facilitate prompt rectification, thus maintaining high levels of
      performance and leading to continuous improvement. In this way, the use of
      non-conformities helps in the overall self-regulation of safety
      management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monitoring may also be performed by external bodies as a way of enforcing
      the maintenance of the standard. Supplier audits, mentioned earlier in
      this chapter, are a good example of such an enforcement approach. Whilst
      there will not be any criminal proceedings, the threat of losing a
      contract following a supplier audit, or of suffering damage to reputation,
      may be sufficient to ensure that an organisation maintains a high standard
      of performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the audit is completed by an awarding body, the threat of losing
      certification altogether becomes even more serious, since it is not just
      one contract that may be affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, it may be said that the use of accredited standards are an
      important ingredient of a self-regulatory model and that non-conformances
      can be used by both the organisation and external stakeholders to monitor
      performance and facilitate continuous improvement.
