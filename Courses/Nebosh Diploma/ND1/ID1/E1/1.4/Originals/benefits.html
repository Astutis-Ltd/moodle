        Benefits of schemes that promote co-operation<br />on health and safety
        between companies<br />
      </h2>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      Not all organisations have access to directly-employed competent health
      and safety advice. This is especially true of small companies and
      ‘micro-businesses’ that may not have the resources to seek and pay for
      professional health and safety advice. In such cases, larger organisations
      may be in a position where they can share knowledge and expertise with the
      smaller organisations to their mutual benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      An example of this would be a large organisation that uses small
      contracting companies. When the small company tenders for a contract, it
      may be asked to provide information on its safety arrangements. This will
      be evaluated by the safety experts in the large company and the answers
      taken into account when awarding the contract. If the small company is
      considered to have unsatisfactory arrangements for the management of
      safety, the larger company could simply refuse to consider them any
      further. However, schemes such as the HSE’s Good neighbour scheme operate
      to encourage those organisations with good safety resources to share
      knowledge and best practice with those that do not.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the above situation, the larger company could help the smaller one to
      develop its safety systems, perhaps by creating an action plan or even
      offering some free advice from its safety practitioner. Such an approach
      could potentially strengthen the working relationship between the two
      organisations, with the smaller company becoming safer and the larger one
      benefitting from employing a contractor with a known good standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Supplier auditing</strong> is another common method of ensuring
      that desired standards are met and of promoting co-operation on health and
      safety between organisations. This approach involves sending an auditor to
      a supplier’s premises to check on such things as quality of manufacturing
      processes, as well as safety management and environmental issues. Agreed
      standards will need to be achieved and maintained if the contract is to
      continue, which will have an obvious influence on the way in which the
      supplier manages itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of the above examples could be said to be part of an<strong>
        ‘Input-Process-Output’ </strong
      >model, where a company seeks to ensure that the inputs to its production
      processes, for example, are a known standard and will not ‘contaminate’
      its own arrangements. Such schemes facilitate the sharing of best practice
      and help to improve standards of health and safety management
      industry-wide.
