        Effects on business of adverse stakeholder<br />reaction to health and
        safety concerns<br />
      </h2>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      It should go without saying that, whatever the accuracy of a report, a
      health and safety concern can have a detrimental effect on stakeholder
      perception, which can lead to reduced investment and to less take-up of
      the company’s product.

    <p>
      At the time of writing, there is a Europe-wide scandal over the presence
      of horsemeat in processed foods. Even though horsemeat itself is not
      dangerous, supermarket chains that stock processed foods have seen a
      marked decrease in sales. It remains to be seen what the full extent of
      the scandal is, but it is already apparent that the supermarket chains may
      be losing money because of it. The consequence of this has also been that
      local butchers’ shops are seeing a boom in sales.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following a health and safety concern in a given organisation, other
      organisations may be reluctant to do business with it, for reasons
      outlined in the previous sub-section. This can lead to reduced revenues
      and a corresponding reduction in profits. In turn, there might be less
      money available to invest in health and safety initiatives, equipment and
      personnel, meaning that standards inevitably start to deteriorate. This
      ultimately leads to higher rates of accidents, incidents and ill-health,
      which raises further concerns about the organisation’s overall approach to
      safety management. In some cases, this can become a vicious circle from
      which it may be hard to recover.

      The <strong>Perrier mineral water </strong>contamination incident of 1990
      was a case in point.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1990, tests of this famous brand of sparkling mineral water showed the
      presence of benzene (a known carcinogen) in a small sample of bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrier water was in part marketed on the basis of its purity, so the
      revelation that samples contained a potentially carcinogenic contaminant
      had a significant impact on the company’s share price as stocks were
      withdrawn and consumer confidence was shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      A company spokesman reassured the public that there was no significant
      health risk. This was echoed by a spokesman for the US Food and Drug
      Administration, who said his agency’s Hazard Evaluation Board had
      collected samples of Perrier and found no immediate risk to the public
      from the benzene in the water. He said:

          be that over many years, if you consumed about 16 fluid ounces a day,
          your lifetime risk of cancer might increase by one in a million, which
          we consider a negligible risk. You don’t have to be concerned if you
          just had a bottle of Perrier.</em

      Despite these reassurances, 70 million bottles of Perrier water were
      withdrawn from shelves in the USA, followed by further recalls as
      contamination was found in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The water was withdrawn for several months until the source of the
      contamination could be identified and the purity of the product restored.
      By the time the product was reintroduced, many consumers had moved away
      from the brand to others that they felt were just as good.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1992, Perrier was bought out by the Nestlé Corporation and by 1995 its
      market share in North America had fallen to half the pre-incident level.
