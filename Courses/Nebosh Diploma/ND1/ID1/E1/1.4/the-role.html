    <p>
      The principle of corporate governance is closely related to that of
      self-regulation insofar as the organisation sets itself targets for
      compliance with certain standards of its choosing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corporate governance principles can be applied to most organisations, but
      it is the larger ones who potentially have the most use for them and who
      stand to reap the greatest benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the 1990s a series of reports into the management of large
      corporations were developed into a non-statutory code of practice that, in
      the UK is now administered by the Financial Reporting Council. The code is
      further supported and reinforced by the rules that companies who are
      listed on the London Stock Exchange must follow. This code of practice
      therefore provides a framework for the management of all risks within a
      business, the aim being to safeguard the company’s assets and the
      shareholders’ investments.
    </p>
    <p>
      A widely-used term in corporate governance is ‘internal control’. A system
      of internal control requires the Board to take an active role in the
      management of a range of risks faced by the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Board are charged with identifying the risks to the business and with
      considering how well the business is capable of dealing with those risks.
      Where doubts over the organisation’s ability to deal with certain risks
      are raised, the Board is charged with taking the lead in managing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of Board-level involvement in the identification and management
      of business risks sits well alongside the principle that health and safety
      should be led by the most senior people in the organisation. Direct
      involvement of the Board in this way has the following benefits:

      </ul>

    <p>
      The process starts with the senior management team recognising that health
      and safety is an important issue and establishing their commitment to its
      management. Health and safety management systems, such as ISO 45001, which
      is suited to larger organisations, embody this principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The management team, having recognised that safety is important and having
      made a commitment to high standards can then be involved in setting the
      strategic direction for health and safety management. Since the top-level
      decision makers have been involved, this should mean that any safety and
      health management initiatives are aligned with wider business risk
      management issues, thus further helping to embed principles of effective
      safety management throughout the organisation and reducing the impression
      that health and safety is a secondary function to be considered only
      because legislation says so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having set standards, it will be up to the Board to ensure that adequate
      resources are provided and that appropriately competent persons are
      appointed to manage safety issues on a day-to-day basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the Board should periodically review progress against the targets
      it has set. Once again, this is fully in line with the requirements of
      standard safety management systems such as ISO 45001. The results of the
      review will allow the Board to set new targets based on current
      achievements, the aim being to improve continuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Achievement of targets and the establishment of high standards of safety
      and health management can be capitalised upon by reporting such successes
      in the company annual report, thus helping to gain competitive advantage.
