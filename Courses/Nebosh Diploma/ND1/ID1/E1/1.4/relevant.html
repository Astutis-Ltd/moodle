      <p>Employer bodies</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      These are bodies that work to promote the interests of employers
      generally, a good example of which is the Confederation of British
      Industry (CBI). According to the CBI website their mission is:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        ...to promote the conditions in which businesses of all sizes and
        sectors in the UK can compete and prosper for the benefit of all. To
        achieve this, we campaign in the UK, the EU and internationally for a
        competitive policy landscape.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      Since health and safety issues affect all organisations to some degree,
      the CBI and organisations like it (such as chambers of commerce) in other
      countries around the world will be involved in active lobbying of
      Government to help to ensure that health and safety policy and legislation
      does not adversely affect the growth and development of those
      organisations that it serves.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Trade associations</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Whereas organisations such as the CBI and the Federation of Small
      Businesses act for employers generally, trade associations are associated
      more closely with specific areas of economic activity. Trade associations
      work to promote developments and improvements in quality, health and
      safety and environmental management, as well as in technical standards.
      They do this in a number of ways, including publishing guidelines,
      information and briefing notes on regulatory developments, as well as
      codes of practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safety issues of relevance to the industry or trade group represented by a
      trade association are circulated to members on a regular basis, thus
      helping to keep the membership up to date with current issues and
      developments. This helps to regulate health and safety performance through
      the development of ‘industry best practice’, which forms a useful frame of
      reference for member companies and which may be referred to by the
      enforcing authorities when conducting incident investigations.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Trade unions</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Trade unions represent the interests of workers, rather than those of
      employers. Of central importance to the role of a trade union is
      employment protection, which includes health and safety issues. A trade
      union will lobby employers to ensure that employment rights are upheld and
      satisfactory standards of workplace health, safety and welfare are
      maintained. They will also provide support to those of their members who
      may wish to challenge the policies or actions of their employers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trade unions were very powerful in the UK around the time that the Health
      and Safety at Work Act was introduced, meaning that they were able to
      influence policy makers to include, within the Act and in subsequent
      Regulations, specific rights for union-appointed safety representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well as appointing safety representatives, trade unions also run
      training courses in health and safety and provide a great deal of relevant
      information to their membership. The unions remain a powerful force for
      workers’ rights and continually lobby Government on behalf of the labour
      force.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Professional groups</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      These are organisations that are set up to support, govern and regulate
      the professions. There are many examples, such as the Institute of
      Chemical Engineers (IChemE), the Chartered Management Institute (UK), the
      Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (USA), Occupational Therapy
      Australia, American Society of Safety Professionals (ASSP) (formerly the
      American Society of Safety Engineers -ASSE) , the Board of Certified
      Safety Professionals (BCSP) and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the context of health and safety, the major professional associations
      are the American Society of Safety Professionals (ASSP) and the UK-based
      Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH), which, with more
      than 47 000 members worldwide, is the biggest health and safety membership
      organisation in the world. IOSH is the world’s only Chartered body for
      health and safety professionals and is the first European safety body to
      be awarded NGO (non- governmental organisation) status by the ILO.
    </p>
    <p>
      IOSH regulates its members through a code of conduct, with which all
      Chartered members and Fellows must adhere. They also regulate and
      administer the system for professional development, ensuring that current
      and future health and safety practitioners maintain the highest level of
      knowledge and competence in their chosen field. IOSH runs regular safety
      campaigns and lobbies Government on behalf of the profession to ensure
      that health and safety issues remain on the agenda.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Pressure groups</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      These are non-governmental groups of individuals who hold similar values,
      and who campaign for action to promote change on specific issues. Such
      groups often represent alternative viewpoints that may not be well
      represented in the mainstream. The formation of a pressure group therefore
      helps to raise awareness of issues, and can result in influence being
      brought to bear on political parties and governmental policy makers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a group in the UK known as ‘Families Against Corporate
      Killers’ (FACK) describes itself as:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        ‘a national campaigning network which will campaign to stop workers and
        others being killed in preventable incidents and will direct bereaved
        families to sources of legal help and emotional support’.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>The general public</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      This is the largest group of all. Public opinion can be very influential
      in government decision making, but is likely to be heavily influenced by
      the media (see below). By themselves, individual members of the public
      cannot exert direct influence, but if they band together in pressure
      groups, or lobby their MP in sufficient numbers, then they can become a
      catalyst for change.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the context of health and safety at work, public perception can have
      some influence. In the UK, members of the public regularly read reports of
      ridiculous decisions made in the name of health and safety (but not by
      trained safety practitioners), which create an impression that the health
      and safety profession as a whole ‘gets in the way’ or is unnecessary. This
      perception can carry over into the workplace, working against otherwise
      worthwhile safety arrangements. Ultimately, if such negative perceptions
      are held widely enough, they may even influence government to act to
      reduce what is felt to be an over-abundance of rules and ‘red-tape’,
      leading to a reduction in controls and an increase in risk.
