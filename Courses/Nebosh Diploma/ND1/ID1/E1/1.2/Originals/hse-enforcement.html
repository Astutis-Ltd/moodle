    <p>
      The HSE enforcement policy states that ‘enforcement’ has a wide meaning
      and applies to all dealings between enforcing authorities and duty holders
      (employers, the self-employed, employees and others).

      The following five principles of enforcement apply to both enforcement in

      whole.

        <strong>Proportionality</strong>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Enforcement action should be proportionate to the risks, or to the
        seriousness of any breach, which includes any actual or potential harm
        arising from a breach of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        The enforcing authorities should take particular account of how far the
        duty holder has fallen short of what the law requires and the extent of
        the risks to people arising from the breach.
      </p>
      <p>Duty holders will be expected to follow relevant good practice.</p>

        <strong>Targeting</strong>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Enforcing authority efforts should be targeted primarily on those whose
        activities give rise to the most serious risks or where the hazards are
        least well controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Action should be focused on the duty holders who are responsible for the
        risk and who are best placed to control it – whether employers,
        manufacturers, suppliers, or others.

        <strong>Consistency</strong>

      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Consistency of approach does not mean uniformity. It means taking a
        similar approach in similar circumstances to achieve similar ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice consistency is not a simple matter. Decisions on enforcement
        action are discretionary and require consideration of a range of
        variables including the degree of risk, the attitude and competence of
        management, any history of incidents or breaches involving the duty
        holder, previous enforcement action, and the seriousness of any breach.
      </p>
      <p>
        All enforcing authorities are required to have arrangements in place to
        promote consistency in the exercise of discretion.

        <strong>Transparency</strong>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Transparency means helping duty holders to understand what is expected
        of them and what they should expect from the enforcing authorities. The
        enforcing authorities should make clear to duty holders not only what
        they have to do, but also what they don’t, by distinguishing between
        statutory requirements and advice or guidance about what is desirable
        but not compulsory.

        <strong>Accountability</strong>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Regulators are accountable to the public for their actions. This means
        that enforcing authorities must have policies and standards against
        which they can be judged, and an effective and easily accessible
        mechanism for dealing with comments and handling complaints.
