    <p>
      The HSE enforcement policy states that ‘enforcement’ has a wide meaning
      and applies to all dealings between enforcing authorities and duty holders
      (employers, the self-employed, employees and others).
    </p>
    <p>The purpose of enforcement is to:</p>

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          ensure that duty holders take action to deal immediately with serious
          risks
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          promote and achieve sustained compliance with the law
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          ensure that duty holders who breach health and safety requirements are
          held to account.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      The following five principles of enforcement apply to both enforcement in
      particular cases, and the HSE’s management of enforcement activities as a
      whole.
    </p>

    <div class="ast-blue-box-container">
      <div class="ast-blue-box-p ast-table__ctn__wrp__data__row-even">

          <span style="color: #a243ff">1)</span>
          Proportionality
        </p>
        <p>
          Enforcement action should be proportionate to the risks, or to the
          seriousness of any breach, which includes any actual or potential harm
          arising from a breach of the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          The enforcing authorities should take particular account of how far
          the duty holder has fallen short of what the law requires and the
          extent of the risks to people arising from the breach.
        </p>
        <p>Duty holders will be expected to follow relevant good practice.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 40px" class="ast-bold">
          <span style="color: #a243ff">2)</span>
          Targeting
        </p>
        <p>
          Enforcing authority efforts should be targeted primarily on those
          whose activities give rise to the most serious risks or where the
          hazards are least well controlled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Action should be focused on the duty holders who are responsible for
          the risk and who are best placed to control it – whether employers,
          manufacturers, suppliers, or others.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 40px" class="ast-bold">
          <span style="color: #a243ff">3)</span>
          Consistency
        </p>
        <p>
          Consistency of approach does not mean uniformity. It means taking a
          similar approach in similar circumstances to achieve similar ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice consistency is not a simple matter. Decisions on
          enforcement action are discretionary and require consideration of a
          range of variables including the degree of risk, the attitude and
          competence of management, any history of incidents or breaches
          involving the duty holder, previous enforcement action, and the
          seriousness of any breach.
        </p>
        <p>
          All enforcing authorities are required to have arrangements in place
          to promote consistency in the exercise of discretion.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 40px" class="ast-bold">
          <span style="color: #a243ff">4)</span>
          Transparency
        </p>
        <p>
          Transparency means helping duty holders to understand what is expected
          of them and what they should expect from the enforcing authorities.
          The enforcing authorities should make clear to duty holders not only
          what they have to do, but also what they don’t, by distinguishing
          between statutory requirements and advice or guidance about what is
          desirable but not compulsory.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 40px" class="ast-bold">
          <span style="color: #a243ff">5)</span>
          Accountability
        </p>
        <p>
          Regulators are accountable to the public for their actions. This means
          that enforcing authorities must have policies and standards against
          which they can be judged, and an effective and easily accessible
          mechanism for dealing with comments and handling complaints.
