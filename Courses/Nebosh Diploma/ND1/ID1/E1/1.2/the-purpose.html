    <p>
      Health and safety legislation imposes a range of duties on employers and
      others to ensure the health, safety and welfare of people at work and the
      health and safety of others who could be affected by the work. The
      required standards of behaviour captured in legislation are the minimum
      acceptable standards of the society at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enforcement agencies are required to ensure that minimum acceptable
      standards are met and maintained or exceeded and that where the required
      standards are not met that the duty holders are held to account.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the UK the law on health and safety at work is regulated by the Health
      and Safety Executive (HSE) and Local Authorities (LAs). The role of the
      regulators is to ensure that businesses are effectively and
      proportionately managing their health and safety risks to workers and
      others. The regulators are able to use a range of interventions to
      influence, encourage and advise businesses to improve the management of
      health and safety risks and, where necessary, hold to account those who
      fail to meet their responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>Enforcement is intended to ensure that duty holders:</p>

          deal immediately with serious risks

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">comply with the law</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          are held to account if they fail in their responsibilities.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The emphasis of the enforcement agencies efforts is on prevention but
      strong punitive action is taken where appropriate, such as when people are
      put at serious risk or there is deliberate flouting of the law.
