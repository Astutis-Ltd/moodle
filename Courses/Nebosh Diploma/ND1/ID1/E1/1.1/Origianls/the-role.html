        The role, function and limitations of legislation<br />

    <p>
      It is clear that there are economic and social benefits to be gained from
      the effective management of health and safety. For some organisations,
      these benefits alone will provide sufficient motivation for them to take
      action to establish and give effect to arrangements that safeguard the
      health, safety and welfare at work of their employees and others who may
      be affected by their activities. However, not all organisations share such
      an enlightened view. Therefore, it has become necessary to establish
      formal rules of law on the management of safety that seek to ensure that
      organisations meet at least a minimum standard. In many jurisdictions
      around the world, these standards are to be found in legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term ‘legislation’ (also referred to as ‘statute law’) refers to law
      that is enacted by a country’s legislature or governing body. Legislation
      may take a number of forms, such as Acts of Parliament / Congress,
      Regulations (sometimes known as ‘Statutory instruments’), Orders etc.
      Collectively, legislation describes the minimum standards to be met by a
      duty holder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health and safety legislation operates in two ways. First it offers a
      frame of reference for duty holders, such that they know in general terms
      what is expected of them. Second, it offers the option of criminal
      punishment and / or civil remedies in the event that standards fall below
      an acceptable level. This threat of sanctions acts as another source of
      motivation for employers to address health and safety concerns that might
      otherwise be left.
    </p>

      Examples of well-known items of health and safety legislation include:

        The Model Work Health and Safety (WHS) Act, 2011, – an Australian

    <p>
      What all of these legislative provisions have in common is that they lay
      down general principles to be applied and observed by named duty holders,
      who, in the context of health and safety are mainly employers, but also
      include workers, manufacturers and suppliers, landlords, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the fact that legislation such as that identified above sets out
      general principles can be seen both as a strength and as a weakness. It is
      a strength insofar as the basic requirements should be clear and should
      give the duty holder a starting point when considering how to manage
      health and safety issues. It is a weakness in that general principles may
      not be enough, since they do not set out clear and unequivocal rules to
      follow to meet a specific situation. This means a degree of judgement is
      needed if the legal standard is to be met, which can lead to
      non-compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also the fact that legislative requirements, while necessary,
      seek to impose duties rather than leaving it to the parties to decide of
      their own volition what action to take. This may mean that an organisation
      will put in place certain arrangements, not because it sees them as being
      intrinsically valuable to the business, but because it is legally obliged
      to do so. This sort of approach is seen regularly in statements of safety
      policy which use phrases like ‘The Company acknowledges that it is under a
      legal obligation to’ or ‘The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 requires
      us to...’ In such cases, it might be said that the company is only aiming
      to establish legal compliance and has limited intention to go beyond that
      level, preferring instead to do the minimum required by law. However, the
      counter-argument is that most organisations will feel compelled to at
      least take some form of action to manage health and safety issues, if only
      to avoid criminal penalties or civil proceedings.
