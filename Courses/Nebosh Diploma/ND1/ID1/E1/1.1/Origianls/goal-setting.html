        ‘Goal-setting’ and ‘prescriptive’ legal models<br />
      </h3>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      There are two alternative styles of health and safety law, known as
      ‘goal-setting’ and ‘prescriptive’.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Prescriptive’ approaches seek to set out exactly what a duty holder must
      do to comply with the law. Much of the health and safety legislation in
      the USA is considered to be prescriptive in nature. The clear and
      unequivocal nature of such requirements offers a higher degree of
      certainty than the alternative ‘goal-setting’ approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      A weakness of the prescriptive approach lies in the fact that law may be
      written to encompass all manner of different types of working environment
      and sizes of organisation, making it virtually impossible to produce a set
      of rules that can be applied equally in all cases. This may mean that
      small businesses in particular are at a disadvantage, as they have to meet
      the same standards as their larger, better resourced cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goal-setting approaches, such as those used in the UK since the 1970’s and
      Europe generally since the late 1980’s, are risk management approaches
      based on the premise that those who create workplace risks are best placed
      to determine how to manage them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the UK, the law on health and safety at work has developed from the
      very early 19th century. Highly prescriptive laws developed along industry
      lines, with different laws for factories, construction, offices and shops,
      agriculture, offshore and so on. Over time the system of health and safety
      law in the UK became unwieldy and fragmented, so in the early 1970s a
      commission headed by Lord Robens was established to see what could be done
      to address the problem. The Robens Commission recognised a need for change
      and recommended that the old system of prescriptive, industry-centric law
      be replaced with a single ‘goal-setting’ Act of Parliament that set out
      general principles in such a way that individual duty holders were given
      the flexibility to tailor their safety management solution to meet the
      needs of their particular working environment. This recommendation led, in
      1974, to the enactment of the Health and Safety at Work Act, which is
      recognised as being one of the most successful pieces of health and safety
      legislation in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approach adopted by the UK’s Health and Safety at Work Act, and other
      similar legislation from other jurisdictions, is a ‘goal-setting’ one.
      This allows organisations the flexibility to put in place measures that
      are relevant and appropriate to them without being constrained by rules
      that are more suited to an entirely different set of circumstances. Risk
      assessment becomes the guiding factor in a goal-setting regime. The
      disadvantage of the goal-setting approach is that it does not offer the
      objectivity and certainty of a prescriptive system, and frequently
      requires professional knowledge and judgement to interpret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goal-setting approaches can also lead to differences of opinion, which can
      result in confusion. For example, following a risk assessment, an
      organisation may have put in place control measures that it feels are
      appropriate to the task at hand, but an enforcement officer may take an
      opposing view and bring enforcement action against the company for a
      failure to meet the required standard. Ultimately, such matters are
      resolved by the courts, who will hear evidence from both sides plus, where
      appropriate, from experts in the field, before reaching a decision as to
      what measures were in fact appropriate in the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice, although many systems are goal-setting in nature, there are
      still elements of prescription. An example of this appears in the Health
      and Safety at Work Act, which includes many goal-setting provisions, as
      well as some prescriptive ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      An example of a goal-setting provision is to be found in section 2(1) of
      the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act, which states:

        >
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />

    <p>
      The employer’s goal here is to ensure [...] the health, safety and welfare
      at work of all his employees. The phrase that makes this a goal-setting
      provision, though, is ‘so far as is reasonably practicable’. This allows
      the employer to make a judgement as to the extent of measures that it will
      be appropriate to implement in their particular situation. Thus, this same
      piece of law applies equally to the smallest and to the largest companies
      – it sets out what must be done and leaves it up to the employers to
      decide how to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more prescriptive requirement is found in section 2(3) of the same Act,
      which says:
    </p>

        margin: auto;
        border-radius: 10px;
      "
    >
      <p>
        <em
          >[...] it shall be the duty of every employer to prepare and as often
          as may be appropriate revise a written statement of his general policy
          with respect to the health and safety at work of his employees and the
          organisation and arrangements for the time being in force for carrying
          out that policy, and to bring the statement and any revision of it to
          the notice of all of his employees.</em
        >
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />

    <p>
      This sub-section prescribes not only the requirement to have a safety
      policy, but also sets out what such a document must contain. However, even
      this is not truly prescriptive, since it is up to the employer to decide
      such things as what goes into the statement, what arrangements to set out
      and how often to review the policy.
    </p>

      A further simple comparison can be made between the approaches to
      workplace illumination seen in the USA and Europe.

    <p>
      It falls on the employer to determine what is ‘suitable and sufficient’

      <strong>Hierarchy of state and federal laws</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In some legal systems, such as in the United States, the law is arranged
      hierarchically. In the US system, for example, there is an overarching
      federal law, which sets out law that applies equally to all 50 states. In
      addition to this there are ‘local’ or ‘state’ laws that are peculiar to
      individual states.
    </p>

    <div
      style="
        width: 750px;
        border-radius: 15px;
        padding: 25px;
        margin: auto;
        background-image: linear-gradient(#f4e7ff, #d1a1ff);
      "
    >
      Taxes are a good example of this. Items purchased in the US will attract a
      federal tax, on top of which is levied a state tax that varies from state
      to state. This arrangement is also reflected in the fact that laws are
      enforced by different agencies at County, State and Federal level.
    </div>
    <br />

    <p>
      However, the US law on health and safety at work is federal law, which
      means that one law applies right across the nation, thus avoiding the
      apparent variability of standards and requirements seen in other parts of
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other economic areas have slightly different approaches which do not add
      up to a federal system, but which may have similarities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the European Union (EU), Regulations and Directives are made, which
      apply to all member states. In essence, member states have no flexibility
      to interpret EU Regulations, which automatically bind member states and
      must be complied with. Directives, however, are only binding as to the
      result to be achieved, leaving individual member states free to interpret
      and enact the directive as they see fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, if one travels across Europe, one will see apparent differences in
      standards. If we assume that the legal requirements are being met, then
      the explanation for this apparent difference lies with the differences in
      interpretation of the directive, which can and does create a certain
      amount of inconsistency across the EU. European Union member states retain
      their individual national identities and sovereignty, meaning that they
      are free to enact whatever laws they please, provided they do not conflict
      with EU law. Where conflict does arise, the member state in question will
      be called to account for its actions and may have to make changes to its
      laws to bring it into line with the wider EU requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another example of a difference is the attempt in Australia to harmonise
      Australian health and safety law through the enactment of the Model Work
      Health and Safety Act. Historically, Australian states and territories
      have had their own laws of health and safety but it has been recognised
      that harmonisation might offer advantages in terms of a holistic and
      consistent approach across the country. On 1 January 2012, harmonised laws
      were implemented in New South Wales, Queensland, the Australian Capital
      Territory, the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth.

    </div>

    <p>
      Western Australia, Tasmania and South Australia delayed the introduction
      of the model laws, while Victoria has said that it will not be introducing
      them at all. Thus, companies doing business in more than one state will
      still have to abide by different state laws, in much the same way as
      companies that operate across Europe have to.

    <p>
      The United Arab Emirates (UAE), although ‘United’ in name, have no single
      piece of legislation, federal or local, specifically dealing with health
      and safety. Across the UAE as a whole there are estimated to be around 170
      different pieces of legislation covering health and safety, with clear
      differences in application in each emirate. A number of the UAE’s laws
      contain references to health and safety, but these are often very general
      and lack specific technical requirements or standards of compliance. For
      example, the UAE’s Labor Law includes generic guidelines on health and
      safety standards that can in theory be applied to any industry or
      workplace. However, the practical use of these provisions is limited.
      Therefore, the Labor Law is supplemented by Ministerial Decisions, an
      example of which is number 32 of 1982, which deals specifically with
      construction, although it still avoids technicalities or codified
      requirements.
