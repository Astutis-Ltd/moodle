    </div>
    <br /><br />
    <p>Merryman (1985) defined a ‘legal system’ as:</p>
    <!--QUOTE-->
    <div
      style="
        background-color: #f6ecff;
        width: 725px;
        padding: 25px;
        margin: auto;
        border-radius: 10px;
      "
    >
      <p>
        <em
          >... an operating set of legal institutions, procedures and rules. In
          this sense there are one federal and fifty state legal systems in the
          United States, separate legal systems in each of the other nations,
          and still other distinct legal systems in such organisations as the
          European Economic Community and the United Nations.</em
        >
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      Thus, there are several major ‘legal systems’ currently in use in
      different countries or trading blocs. In some cases, such as with the
      common law, a system will have spread around the world, helping to provide
      some sense of uniformity and consistency, whereas other legal systems
      remain localised to particular geographical areas. Therefore, in an
      increasingly globalised economy, it is important to recognise that a
      company with a presence in more than one country is liable to meet
      different rules, which will be applied in different ways, some of which
      will be more stringent than others.

              The world’s predominant legal system, which is very systematic and
              structured and gives precedence to written (codified) law. This
              system focuses on broad statements of general principles, often
              ignoring details. Civil systems are divided into two main streams,
              <strong>codified </strong>and <strong>uncodified</strong>.

              Examples of <strong>codified </strong>systems can be found in the

              the Canadian province of Quebec. The US state of Louisiana also
              operates under a civil code, making it unique in the USA, the
              other 49 states of which use a common law system

              <strong> Uncodified</strong> civil systems can be found in

              all of whom use the common law.

            Canada, Jamaica, Australia and New Zealand. The common law is based
            on the principle of judicial precedent (Stare decisis), the chief
            feature of which is that the law is not codified in one place but is
            developed on an incremental basis through a series of judicial
            decisions. This allows the common law to keep pace with societal and
            technical change, without the need to revise complex statutory
            provisions.
