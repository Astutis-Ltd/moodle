    <p>
      In the event that a person suffers loss (such as injury or ill-health),
      they may wish to claim damages, the aim of which is to compensate the
      claimant for the loss they sustained and to place him or her, so far as it
      is possible to do so, in the position they would have been in had the loss
      not been suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the injured party dies and leaves behind dependents, then some
      jurisdictions, such as the UK, will allow the surviving dependants to
      bring proceedings in the same way as would have occurred had the injured
      party survived. In the UK this is made possible by the Fatal Accidents Act
      1976.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two main compensatory schemes, known as either the fault or
      no-fault liability systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a fault liability system, both liability (responsibility for the loss)
      and quantum (the amount of compensation to be awarded) will be considered.
      The issue of liability will normally be considered first, followed by a
      consideration of the amount to be paid should the claimant establish their
      case. In complex cases, this frequently requires a separate trial, known
      as a ‘quantum trial’ or ‘quantum hearing’. In a no-fault liability system,
      liability will not be contested, leaving only the issue of quantum to be
      considered.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is important to note that in fault liability systems there is no
      automatic right to compensation. There is also no fixed tariff for amounts
      to award for particular injuries, although guidelines provided by bodies
      like the UK’s Judicial Studies Board do help in the initial assessment of
      general damages, which will be discussed in more detail below.
    </p>
    <p>
      An essential feature of a fault liability system is that, as its name
      suggests, some fault on the part of the defendant(s) must be proved before
      compensation will be paid. The claimant needs to persuade the court that
      ‘on the balance of probabilities’ the defendant is liable. As mentioned
      above, once liability has been determined, the exact amount of
      compensation to be paid can then be discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a fault liability system, claims are made in the law of tort (‘tort’
      being an old Norman-French word meaning a ‘civil wrong’).
    </p>
    <p>
      In tort claims, a claimant (such as an injured worker) would typically sue
      a defendant (such as their employer) in the tort of negligence, alleging
      that a breach of a duty of care that was owed by the employer to the
      injured worker led directly to the injury, and that the employer was
      therefore liable for any losses incurred.
    </p>
    <p>To be successful, the claimant needs to show that:</p>

    <p>
      The fault liability system has distinct advantages, the first and arguably
      most important of which is based on the principle of ‘corrective justice’.
      This principle holds the responsible party accountable for the loss. This
      should motivate prospective duty holders to do what they reasonably can to
      prevent losses from arising in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second major advantage of a fault-based system is that each case is
      considered separately on its merits, allowing damage awards to be tailored
      to meet the specific needs of the claimant. This allows for the
      possibility that a claimant will be found partially responsible for their
      loss (known as ‘contributory negligence’), which will lead to liability
      being apportioned according to the court’s view of the level of
      responsibility that should be borne by each side. Thus, if a court decides
      that the defendant is liable, but that the claimant contributed to his or
      her injuries by, say, 25% (a typical figure for not wearing a seatbelt in
      a road traffic collision), then the final damages award will be reduced by
      25% to reflect that level of responsibility.

        <p>
          The disadvantages of fault liability systems are that the process of
          litigation can take considerably longer, because the issue of primary
          liability will need to be resolved before considering quantum. This
          will lead to greater stress for the claimant, who will be faced with a
          protracted period of litigation followed by trial, the outcome of
          which will be far from certain and may result in a finding that the
          defendant had no liability, leaving the claimant without any damages,
          but possibly with a costly legal bill.

    <p>
      In jurisdictions where fault liability predominates, such as the UK, it is
      essential that employers have in place insurance (known as ‘Employers’
      Liability Insurance’) to cover them in the event of a claim, although
      there are exceptions. There are two important reasons for this:
    </p>

    <!--List Numbered Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ol class="ast-list__numbered">
        <li class="ast-list__numbered__item">
          <div class="ast-list__numbered__item__div">
            The injured party is able to gain access to a fund of money that
            will pay out if they win their case, thus avoiding situations where
            an insolvent employer may not be able to meet a damages award, even
            though they are held liable
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__numbered__item">
          <div class="ast-list__numbered__item__div">
            As premiums are in part assessed on the basis of claims history and
            risk levels, the employer will be motivated to try and reduce the
            premium by maintaining good standards of health and safety, thus
            reducing the risks of injury or ill-health.

    <p>
      Claims from the public and other businesses are covered by Public
      Liability Insurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, it is important to note that, in a fault liability system, the
      insurance will only pay out in cases where the defendant is found liable.
      Also, the insured will generally agree to pay the first $X of a claim in
      return for a lower annual insurance premium (a ‘policy excess’). This
      excess amount can be considerable and may be higher than the sum being
      claimed, meaning that the compensation payment comes from company funds,
      not insurance – a fact that may further motivate employers to take steps
      to reduce risks.
    </p>

      <p>No-fault liability</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      A no-fault liability system is one where fault does not have to be proved,
      although the claimant will still need to show that the defendant was
      involved. For example, the injury occurred at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      These schemes achieve justice through results, rather than by apportioning
      responsibility. Misconduct can go unpunished but the consequences of the
      misconduct are insured against to provide guaranteed funding for medical
      care and vocational rehabilitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good example of a no-fault liability system can be found in New Zealand,
      where a Crown entity known as the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC),
      created under the provisions of New Zealand’s Injury Prevention,
      Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001, provides comprehensive 24 hour
      no-fault personal injury cover to all New Zealand citizens, residents and
      visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contributions to the no-fault liability fund are made from several
      sources:

      The ACC adjudicates on claims. Mediation and conciliation routes are
      available to deal with disputes and there is a right of appeal to an
      independent Appeal Authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not surprisingly, such a system costs a lot of money. In 2019 231 800 new
      work-related injury claims were made including 37 000 more serious
      injuries involving entitlement claims. The total expenditure for 2019 was
      over 8.25 Billion NZD for new and other active claims which includes
      paying for rehabilitation, compensation, administration, injury prevention
      programmes, levy collection, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scheme covers all work accidents and illnesses ‘arising out of and in
      the course of employment’. Employers in New Zealand are required by law to
      have cover, with an invoice being sent by the ACC after June of each year.
      The amount payable by each employer is based on the wage bill and the type
      of work, with up to a 10% discount being available for those employers who
      can demonstrate good safety practices.

      As mentioned, in return for a no-fault system, people have had to give up
      their right to sue for personal injury, although they may still be allowed
      to sue for exemplary damages (see section on ‘Damages’ below). For
      example, in similar systems in the USA and Canada, ‘workers’ compensation’
      schemes, as they are known, contain clauses barring the worker and his /
      her family from bringing an action against the employer, employer’s agent
      or co-worker in respect of personal injury, disablement or death arising
      out of employment. As long ago as 1913, Sir William Meredith, Chief
      Justice of Ontario, noted that:

    <p>
      In the UK, since 1969, it has been compulsory for employers to carry a
      minimum level of employers’ liability insurance cover. At present, this
      must be a minimum of £5 million for each and every claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of claims for compensation against employers as a result of
      accidents fell steadily in the early 21st century and the total cost of
      compensation cases has remained, in real terms, static since 1989.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research in 2005 showed that average damages for an Employers’ Liability
      Insurance (ELI) claim were £7 500. Britain paid out much less on civil
      compensation (as a percentage of GDP) than other major European countries
      and about a third of the USA figure. The average cost of employer’s
      liability insurance was 0.25% of total payroll costs, and was the lowest
      in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2020 there were just over 2 million reported workplace injuries and
      illnesses in the UK. 1.935 million were self-reported through the Labour
      Force Survey (LFS) and over 69 000 were reported by employers as required
      by the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences
      Regulations (RIDDOR).
    </p>
    <p>
      If an employee suffers accidental injury or illness due to work and
      successfully claims for compensation from their employer, the employer
      must notify the Compensation Recovery Unit (CRU) of the details of the
      claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the CRU in 2019 / 20 there were 89 461 successful employers’
      liability claims settled in the UK. This means that roughly 4.5% of
      workplace-related employee injuries and illnesses (1 in 22) ends up with a
      successful claim against the employer.

      Workers compensation systems are administered by the individual states,
      generally by commissions or boards whose responsibility it is to ensure
      compliance with the laws, investigate and decide disputed cases, and
      collect data. In most states employers are required to keep records of
      accidents. Accidents must be reported to the workers compensation board
      and to the company’s insurer within a specified number of days.

      Workers compensation covers an injured worker’s medical care and attempts
      to cover his or her economic loss. This includes loss of earnings and the
      extra expenses associated with the injury. Injured workers receive all
      medically necessary and appropriate treatment from the first day of injury
      or illness and rehabilitation when the disability is severe.

      24 states including New York and California have state-run workers
      compensation funds. In the other states, employers can purchase workers
      compensation coverage from private insurance companies.

      The only state in which workers compensation coverage is truly optional is
      Texas, where about one-third of the state’s employers are so-called
      nonsubscribers.

      injuries arising from motor vehicle collisions are the most costly at $78
      466 per claim filed in 2017 / 18. Other causes with above-average costs
