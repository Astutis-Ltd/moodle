    <p>Merryman (1985) defined a ‘legal system’ as:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        ... an operating set of legal institutions, procedures and rules. In
        this sense there are one federal and fifty state legal systems in the
        United States, separate legal systems in each of the other nations, and
        still other distinct legal systems in such organisations as the European
        Economic Community and the United Nations.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      Thus, there are several major ‘legal systems’ currently in use in
      different countries or trading blocs. In some cases, such as with the
      common law, a system will have spread around the world, helping to provide
      some sense of uniformity and consistency, whereas other legal systems
      remain localised to particular geographical areas. Therefore, in an
      increasingly globalised economy, it is important to recognise that a
      company with a presence in more than one country is liable to meet
      different rules, which will be applied in different ways, some of which
      will be more stringent than others.
    </p>
    <p>Significant legal systems include:</p>

                The world’s predominant legal system, which is very systematic
                and structured and gives precedence to written (codified) law.
                This system focuses on broad statements of general principles,
                often ignoring details. Civil systems are divided into two main
                streams, <span class="ast-bold">codified</span> and
                <span class="ast-bold">uncodified</span>.

                  Examples of <span class="ast-bold">codified</span> systems can
                  be found in the French Civil Code, throughout much of
                  continental Europe, and in the Canadian province of Quebec.
                  The US state of Louisiana also operates under a civil code,
                  making it unique in the USA, the other 49 states of which use
                  a common law system

                  <span class="ast-bold">Uncodified</span> civil systems can be
                  found in Scotland and South Africa. Scotland, being part of
                  the UK, has a very different legal system to that of its
                  immediate neighbours, all of whom use the common law.

              A system that originated in the UK and spread overseas with the
              development of the British Empire to countries such as the USA,
              Canada, Jamaica, Australia and New Zealand. The common law is
              based on the principle of judicial precedent (Stare decisis), the
              chief feature of which is that the law is not codified in one
              place but is developed on an incremental basis through a series of
              judicial decisions. This allows the common law to keep pace with
              societal and technical change, without the need to revise complex
              statutory provisions.
