      The International Labour Organization (ILO) is an agency of the United
      Nations, founded in 1919 in the wake of the First World War. It has a
      unique tripartite structure involving government, employer, and worker
      representatives. It is a forum in which the governments and socio-
      economic stakeholders from the member states can debate and elaborate
      labour standards and policies.

      The ILO’s current mission statement states that it is devoted to promoting
      social justice and internationally recognized human and labour rights,
      pursuing its founding mission that social justice is essential to
      universal and lasting peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ILO has four strategic objectives at the heart of its ‘decent work’
      agenda:

            <p>
              The ILO promotes international labour standards aimed at making
              sure that economic growth and development go along with the
              creation of decent work. International labour standards therefore
              establish the basic minimum social standards agreed upon by all
              actors in the global economy.

              Only 20% of the world’s population has adequate social security

              adequate social protection is a basic right. It is instrumental in
              promoting human welfare and social consensus on a broad scale and
              is essential for fair growth, social stability and economic
              performance.

      Employers’ organisations represent a key asset in any society. Successful
      businesses are at the heart of any strategy to create employment and
      improve living standards. The ILO’s Bureau for Employers’ Activities (ACT
      / EMP) is responsible for the nurturing and development of the ILO’s
      relationship with employers’ organisations.

      <p>How the ILO works</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The ILO aims to bring together governments, employers and workers to set
      labour standards, develop policies and devise programmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ILO encourages this tripartite approach within its constituents and
      member States by promoting a social dialogue between trade unions and
      employers in formulating, and where appropriate, implementing national
      policy on social, economic, and many other issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ILO accomplishes its work through three main bodies (The International
      Labour Conference, the Governing Body and the International Labour Office)
      which comprise governments’, employers’ and workers’ representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governing Body is the ILO’s executive body. It meets three times a
      year, in March, June and October. It takes decisions on ILO policy,
      decides the agenda of the International Labour Conference, adopts the
      draft Programme and Budget of the Organization for submission to the
      Conference and elects the Director-General.
    </p>
    <p>
      The International Labour Office (known simply as ‘The Office’) is the
      permanent secretariat of the ILO.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the focal point for ILO’s overall activities, which it prepares
      under the scrutiny of the Governing Body and under the leadership of the
      Director-General.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work of the Governing Body and of the Office is aided by tripartite
      committees covering major industries. It is also supported by committees
      of experts on occupational safety and health and related matters such as:

    <p>
      The broad policies of the ILO are set by the International Labour
      Conference, which meets once a year in June, in Geneva, Switzerland. This
      annual Conference brings together governments’, workers’ and employer’s
      delegates of the ILO member states.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often called an ‘International parliament of labour’, the Conference
      establishes and adopts international labour standards and is a forum for
      discussion of key social and labour questions. It also adopts the
      Organization’s budget and elects the Governing Body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the 185 member states is represented by a delegation consisting of
      two government delegates, an employer delegate, a worker delegate, and
      their respective advisers. Many of the government representatives are
      cabinet ministers responsible for labour affairs in their own countries.
      Employer and worker delegates are nominated in agreement with the most
      representative national organisations of employers and workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every delegate has the same rights, and all can express themselves freely
      and vote as they wish. Worker and employer delegates may s ometimes vote
      against their government’s representatives or against each other. This
      diversity of viewpoints, however, does not prevent decisions being adopted
      by very large majorities or in some cases even unanimously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heads of State and prime ministers also take the floor at the Conference.
      International organisations, both governmental and others, attend as
      observers.
