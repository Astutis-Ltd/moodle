      <strong>International labour standards</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      International labour standards are legal instruments drawn up by the ILO’s
      constituents (governments, employers and workers) and setting out basic
      principles and rights at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are either conventions, which are legally binding international
      treaties that may be ratified by member states, or recommendations, which
      serve as non-binding guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many cases, a convention lays down the basic principles to be
      implemented by ratifying countries, while a related recommendation
      supplements the convention by providing more detailed guidelines on how it
      could be applied. Recommendations can also be autonomous, i.e. not linked
      to any convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conventions and recommendations are drawn up by representatives of
      governments, employers and workers and are adopted at the ILO’s annual
      International Labour Conference. Once a standard is adopted, member states
      are required under the ILO Constitution to submit them to their competent
      authority (normally their parliament) for consideration. In the case of
      conventions, this means consideration for ratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a convention is ratified, it generally comes into force for that
      country one year after the date of ratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ratifying countries commit themselves to applying the convention in
      national law and practice and reporting on its application at regular
      intervals. The ILO provides technical assistance if necessary. In
      addition, representation and complaint procedures can be initiated against
      countries for violations of a convention they have ratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Declarations are resolutions of the International Labour Conference used
      to make a formal and authoritative statement and reaffirm the importance
      of certain principles and values. They are not subject to ratification,
      but are intended to have a wide application and contain symbolic and
      political undertakings by the member States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Codes of Practice set out practical guidelines for public authorities,
      employers, workers, enterprises, and specialised occupational safety and
      health protection bodies (such as enterprise safety committees). They are
      not legally binding instruments and are not intended to replace the
      provisions of national laws or regulations, or accepted standards.
    </p>
    <p>Codes of Practice provide guidance on:</p>
