    <p>
      Each of the countries that ratify the ILO conventions is obliged to adopt
      them into their own system of legislation. Thus, the Conventions form the
      basis for national systems of health and safety legislation. If one reads
      through the health and safety law of one’s own country, one will probably
      recognise many of the Convention principles. This is evidence that the
      requirements of the Conventions have been considered and applied.
