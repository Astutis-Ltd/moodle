      The above image represents a situation where a client (the employer)
      appoints a contractor to do work on site, where the work will involve the
      contractor's employees and a specialist sub-contractor, who will be
      working in the same area as the employer's own staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each employer has responsibility for ensuring the health and safety of
      their own employees and any non-employees that may be affected.
    </p>
    <p>Effective communication systems are required to ensure that:</p>

      The extent of the responsibilities of each party will depend on the
      circumstances.
