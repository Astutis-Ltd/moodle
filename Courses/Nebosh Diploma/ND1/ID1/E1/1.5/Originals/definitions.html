    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Contractor</strong></p>
    <p>
      A contractor is a party engaged to perform a specific task, without
      direction from the engaging party (client).
    </p>
    <p>
      An independent contractor (i.e. one who has control over the undertaking
      of the work) is responsible for any torts arising from their work.

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Agency Worker</strong></p>
    <p>
      An agency worker is someone who has a contract with an agency (e.g.
      recruitment / `temp’ agency) but works temporarily for a hirer. Agency
      workers are classed as `workers’ rather than `employees’.

    <!--SUB-SUB-HEAD-->
    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Member of the public</strong></p>
    <p>
      A member of the public is a person who is ‘not at work’ and who does not
      fit into other categories such as a trespasser. The term covers people
      off-site such as neighbours and passers-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been held that the common law duty of care is not limited to
      workers in the workplace, but could extend to those nearby residents
      affected.
