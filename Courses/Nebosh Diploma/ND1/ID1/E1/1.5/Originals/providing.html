        Providing risk information to third parties<br />
      </h2>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      Where workplaces are shared and work activities overlap and affect third
      parties, it's imperative that all parties work together to ensure that all
      hazards are identified, and the associated risks understood and managed
      sensibly to protect all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clients / host employers will know about site specific hazards and should
      share information to forewarn and protect visiting contractors.
      Contractors will understand the hazards associated with the commissioned
      works and should share that information with their host to protect
      employees working on site.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the UK, duties under the Health and Safety at Work Act and the
      Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations make clear that
      employers are obliged to protect everyone affected by their activities and
      that cooperation and coordination of efforts between employers sharing a
      work space is essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the legal case of R v Swan Hunter Shipbuilders and Telemeter
      Installations (1982) Swan Hunter distributed a safety booklet to their own
      employees warning of the dangers of oxygen enrichment in confined spaces.
      This booklet was not distributed to contractors (visiting employees of
      another organisation). A fire broke out and a contractor left an oxygen
      hose in the deck. The fire became intense because that part of the ship
      was badly ventilated and the atmosphere became oxygen enriched. As a
      result eight workmen were killed. The Court of Appeal confirmed Swan
      Hunterâ€™s obligation to share the information with Telemeter Installations
      to help keep both sets of workers safe.
