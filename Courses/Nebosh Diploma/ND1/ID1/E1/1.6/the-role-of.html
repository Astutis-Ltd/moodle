    <p>
      Traditionally, a Claim Handler handles the processes of a claim. They can
      normally agree to payouts within a very limited set of internal rules and
      have to refer anything unusual to a colleague with a greater level of
      authority, such as a loss adjuster.

    <p>
      A “Loss Adjuster” is generally empowered to “adjust the loss” which means
      they act with full authority of the insurer to negotiate and settle a
      claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loss adjusters are independent experts who are usually employed by
      insurance companies to resolve complex claims, although they may just
      provide guidance and recommendations to the insurers. The loss adjusters
      role typically involves:

            Verifying whether or not the claimants policy covers the loss or
            damage by reviewing the policy and policy schedule

            Verifying the amount, if any, that the policy should pay out.

      Where the loss adjuster is acting on behalf of an insurer there will
      usually be strict service level agreements to help ensure that the claim
      is dealt with efficiently and fairly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chartered Loss Adjusters are experienced claims professionals who have
      achieved the highest qualification in claims handling. They are members of
      the Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters (CILA) and are therefore bound
      to behave in accordance with the CILA Guide to Professional Conduct.

      The term Loss Assessor is often used to describe an independent insurance
      claim professional contracted by the policy holder to protect their
      interests through the claims process.
