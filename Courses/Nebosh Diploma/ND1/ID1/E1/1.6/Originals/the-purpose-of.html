    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Employers Liability</strong></p>
    <p>
      If a business has employees then it is likely to be required by law for
      the organisation to have employers’ liability insurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an employee is injured or becomes ill as a result of the work they do
      for their employer, they can claim compensation from the employer.
      However, if it is found that the organisation is liable, employers’
      liability insurance will pay any compensation for employees’ injuries or
      illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an organisation takes out employers’ liability insurance, they will
      have an agreement with their insurer about the circumstances in which the
      insurer will pay compensation. For example, the policy will cover the
      specific activities that relate to the business. If however, the insurer
      believes that the employer has failed to meet their legal responsibilities
      for the health and safety of their employees and that this has led to the
      claim, the policy may enable the insurer to sue the employer to reclaim
      the cost.
    </p>
    <br />

    <!--SUB-SUB-HEAD-->
    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Public Liability</strong></p>
    <p>
      Public liability insurance is different from Employer’s Liability. It
      covers organisations for claims made against them by members of the public
      or other businesses, but not for claims by employees. While public
      liability insurance is generally voluntary, employers’ liability insurance
      is compulsory. Organisations can be fined if they do not hold a current
      employers’ liability insurance policy which complies with the law.
