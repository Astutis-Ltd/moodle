      Where the loss adjuster is acting on behalf of an insurer there will
      usually be strict service level agreements to help ensure that the claim
      is dealt with efficiently and fairly.

      Chartered Loss Adjusters are experienced claims professionals who have
      achieved the highest qualification in claims handling. They are members of
      the Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters (CILA) and are therefore bound
      to behave in accordance with the CILA Guide to Professional Conduct.
