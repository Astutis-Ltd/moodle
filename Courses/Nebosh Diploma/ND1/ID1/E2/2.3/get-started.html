      Accident rates are lower where employees genuinely feel they have a say in
      health and safety matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employee involvement in health and safety management relates to a more
      positive health and safety climate – 77% of employees felt encouraged to
      raise concerns in a good health and safety climate compared to 20% who
      felt encouraged to do so in a poor health and safety climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In poor health and safety climates, accident rates are highest among
      workplaces where employees do not feel they can have a say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stronger employee involvement means better control of common workplace
      risks such as slips and trips – very effective in 76% of cases where
      employees felt they were always consulted but only very effective in 40%
      of cases if they thought they were rarely, or never, consulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employers can learn about the risks through consultation – the risk of
      stress and slips and trips occur practically everywhere, but awareness of
      them is higher where there is employee involvement (62%) compared to where
      there is no involvement (28%).
    </p>
    <p>
      Research has also shown that workplaces with health and safety committees
      where some members are selected by unions have significantly lower rates
      of work-related injury than those found in workplaces with no co-operative
      health and safety management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Workplaces where employees are involved in taking decisions about health
      and safety are safer and healthier as employees influence health and
      safety through their own actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A workforce that feels valued and involved in decision-making plays a big
      part in a high-performing workplace. Empowering the workforce, giving them
      the right skills, and getting them involved in making decisions shows them
      that their health, safety and wellbeing is taken seriously. Workers are
      not only able to raise concerns but offer solutions too. There can be an
      impact far beyond health and safety management if the workforce is not
      engaged on health and safety issues which affect them.

      <p>What the law requires</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>The legal framework for consultation in the UK is shown below:</p>

      <img
        style="max-width: 600px"
        src="https://mylearning.astutis.com/pluginfile.php/307/mod_book/chapter/389/cgdi0224_law_on_consultation_brand%20V2-web%20%281%29.jpg"
        alt=""
        class="ast-img"
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      The legal requirements for consultation specify a minimum requirement.
      Building upon this legal foundation to create a genuine partnership
      between employers and employees creates a culture of collaboration where
      concerns, ideas and solutions are shared and acted upon, and where the
      whole workforce is engaged in the management of health and safety.
    </p>
    <p>HSE research has shown that stronger employee involvement means:</p>

      If a recognised trade union appoints ‘safety representatives’ the employer
      shoul consult with them on health and safety matters affecting the
      employees they represent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a small business where trade unions are not present consulting directly
      with individuals is often effective in giving everyone a chance to have a
      say in health and safety matters.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Commitment from all sides is vital for employee involvement to be
      effective and successful in making improvements to health and safety. This
      means the employer, employees, and trade unions where they are recognised,
      need to gain buy-in to the process.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Leadership and commitment from management is important in making
      involvement successful. Beyond the legal duty to consult there are many
      positive reasons for management to commit to consultation with the
      workforce.

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Provide reassurance that it will not diminish effective management

          views of others are considered and respected.

      Employees are more likely to engage and believe in consultation when
      senior managers show personal and long-term commitment and listen to the
      views of employees because they want to hear what the workforce has to
      say.
