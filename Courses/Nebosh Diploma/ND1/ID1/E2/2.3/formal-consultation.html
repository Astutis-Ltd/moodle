    <p>
      Consultation is a two way process. Employees should be active participants
      in the process and have an opportunity to express their opinions.
      Consultation should occur prior to any decision being made.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Formal consultation’ refers to consultation that is required within the
      legal framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legal requirements for consultation specify a minimum requirement.
      Building upon this legal foundation to create a genuine partnership
      between employers and employees creates a culture of collaboration where
      concerns, ideas and solutions are shared and acted upon, and where the
      whole workforce is engaged in the management of health and safety.

      Research from the UK’s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has shown that
      stronger employee involvement means:

      The workforce should be consulted about anything in the workplace that
      could substantially affect their health and safety. The specifics will
      vary from workplace to workplace.

    <p>In general the workforce must be consulted about:</p>
