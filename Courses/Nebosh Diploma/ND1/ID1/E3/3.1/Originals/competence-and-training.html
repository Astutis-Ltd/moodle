      Competence is commonly held to be the ability to perform the activities
      within an occupation or function, to the standards expected in employment.
      This definition makes reference to standards, thus competence assessment
      is necessary to ensure that a person can perform to the required standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept of competence, in the health and safety context, has been
      legally defined within case law from the 1960s onwards.
    </p>
    <p>A competent man may be considered to be:</p>

      Work Regulations 1999 (MHSWR) as the ability to perform to a required

      This approach is consistent with the general UK approach to competence
      through occupational standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the late 1970s and early 1980s, faced with rising unemployment and the
      eradication of traditional industry, the government established the
      Manpower Services Commission (MSC) as a vehicle to improve workplace
      skills and employee mobility. The approach taken was focused on defining
      desired outcomes from operational activities and became known as a
      competence based approach, eventually leading to the system of National
      Vocational Qualifications (NVQs).
    </p>

      The definition of occupational competence provided by the Manpower
      Services Commission (MSC) and Investors in People (IiP) is:
