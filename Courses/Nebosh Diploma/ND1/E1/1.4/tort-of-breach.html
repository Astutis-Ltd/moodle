    <p>
      The courts have considered at length whether or not a person, injured as a
      consequence of the failure of another to perform a statutory duty, could
      bring a civil action based on that failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courts have generally held that action can be taken for the tort of
      breach of statutory duty (TBSD) in relation to occupational health and
      safety legislation, although there are notable exceptions and it cannot be
      presumed that all breaches of statutory duty will be actionable in civil
      courts. This will depend upon the purposes and objects of the statute in
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      To bring a successful action under the Tort of Breach of Statutory Duty
      (TBSD) the claimant must show five things:

            a glazier was carrying a sheet of glass down a stairway 5 feet 6
            inches wide, which had no guard rail, when he fell from a height of
            between two and three feet sustaining injuries.
          </p>
          <p>
            The courts debated the meanings of guard rail and hand rail under
            Regulation 27 of the Building (Safety, Health and Welfare)
            Regulations 1948 and held there was no breach of statutory duty, as
            he would not have been able to use a hand rail and that the function
            of a hand rail was not to protect against falling as per a guard
            rail.

              >Fytche v Wincanton Logistics plc (2004)</span
            >
            the claimant was employed to drive a 32-tonne articulated bulk dairy
            tanker. In wintry conditions in December 1999 the tanker got stuck
            on an icy country road. Rather than follow company procedures to
            telephone and wait for help, Mr Fytche decided to dig the tanker
            out. After about three hours working in the snow he was able to
            drive off. One of Mr Fytches boots leaked through a tiny hole next
            to the little toe and he suffered frostbite as a result. He brought
            an action for damages, alleging a breach of Regulation 7 of the
            Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992.
          </p>
          <p>
            His claim failed. The obligation imposed on an employer to maintain
            and repair personal protective equipment, under Regulation 7(1) of
            the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992 related
            purely to the risk in relation to which the equipment was supplied.
          </p>
          <p>
            The boots were provided to protect against the risk of injury to
            feet from a milk churn.

            machine. He brought an action for a breach of Section 14 of the
            Factories Act 1961 – the duty to fence dangerous parts of machinery.
          </p>
          <p>
            The claim failed. Section 14 was intended to prevent the worker from
            coming into contact with the machine, not to stop parts of the
            machine from being thrown at the worker.

            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The claim was dismissed as the degree of risk arising from the
            spillage was very small and the only way to protect against it would
            have been totally disproportionate to the risks involved.

            a steel erector fell seventy feet from a steel tower in the building
            of which he was assisting and was killed. The employers provided
            safety belts for steel erectors on site but as they were not being
            used, they were taken to another site. His widow sued for a breach
            of Section 26(2) of the Factories Act 1937 for failing to provide a
            safety belt.
          </p>
          <p>
            The House of Lords held that the employer was not liable in damages
            because the breach of duty was not the cause of the damage suffered
            since (a) on the evidence the deceased would not have worn a safety
            belt if it had been provided, and (b) there was no duty on the

      <span class="ast-bold">Grieves v FT Everard and Sons (2005)</span>) raised
      an interesting point regarding what constitutes actionable damage. The
      presence of pleural plaques (areas of scar tissues on the membrane
      surrounding the lung) did not, by itself, justify an award of compensation
      as pleural plaques are symptomless and have no adverse effect on the body.

      award.
