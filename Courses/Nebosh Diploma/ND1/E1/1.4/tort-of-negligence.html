      Negligence may be explained as careless conduct injuring another. In legal
      terms it was defined by Lord Wright in
      <span class="ast-bold"

        "In strict legal analysis, negligence means more than heedless or
        careless conduct, whether in omission or commission: it properly
        connotes the complex concept of duty, breach and damage thereby suffered
        by the person to whom the duty was owing."

    <p>
      Prior to 1932 there was no generalised duty of care in negligence. The
      tort was only applied in particular situations where the courts had
      decided that a duty should be owed, such as road accidents or dangerous
      goods.

            In <span class="ast-bold">Donoghue v Stevenson (1932)</span> Lord
            Atkin attempted to lay down a general principle which would cover
            all the circumstances where there could be liability for negligence.
            He said:
          </p>
          <p class="ast-italic">
            "You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you
            can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.
            Who, then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be – persons
            who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought
            reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I
            am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in
            question."

          <p>
            The requirements that must now be satisfied before a duty of care is
            held to exist were established by Lord Bridge in
            <span class="ast-bold">Caparo Industries v Dickman (1990).</span>

      The standard of care required was defined in
      <span class="ast-bold">Paris v Stepney Borough Council (1951)</span> as
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >the care which an ordinary prudent employer would take in all the

    <p>
      What is reasonable will vary with context, and with the characteristics of
      the individual to whom the duty is owed. In general, a greater level of
      care must be taken of more vulnerable individuals, such as children or
      disabled persons.

            <span class="ast-bold">Paris v Stepney Borough Council (1951)</span>
            the House of Lords held that where a workman had a disability which
            increased the risk of serious injury, if he was injured in an
            accident, the special risk of injury was a relevant consideration in
            determining the precautions the employer should take to fulfil his
            duty of care to the workman.

            In <span class="ast-bold">Yachuk v. Oliver Blais Co. (1949)</span> a
            nine year old boy lied to a petrol station attendant to obtain a
            container of petrol. The boy claimed his mother’s car had run out of
            fuel, but he actually wanted it to light a bonfire. The boy was
            injured in an explosion when lighting the petrol soaked timber.
          </p>
          <p>
            The court held that the petrol station attendant was negligent in
            selling the petrol to the child, and that he owed a greater duty of
            care to a child than an adult when selling petrol.

            In the case of
            <span class="ast-bold">Latimer v AEC Ltd. (1953),</span> a factory
            floor was flooded after an unusually heavy rainfall. After the flood
            subsided the floor was left slippery, so was treated with sawdust.
            There was not enough sawdust to treat the whole floor, so it was
            used where the need was felt to be greatest. Subsequently Latimer
            slipped on an untreated section of floor and was injured.
          </p>
          <p>
            AEC Ltd was held to have taken reasonable precautions and exercised
            reasonable care.

      If harm cannot be foreseen, the defendant cannot be held liable for it. In

            Dr Daniel was a GP retained by Abbey National to provide medical

          <p>
            Ms Kapfunde was refused a permanent position with Abbey National on
            the basis of Dr Daniel’s advice that, as a sickle cell anaemia

            absence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ms Kapfunde argued that Dr Daniels owed her a duty of care in
            relation to the information she had provided concerning her sickness
