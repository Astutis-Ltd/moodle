    <p>
      As discussed earlier, for the injured party (claimant) to succeed in a
      negligence claim, he must prove:
    </p>

    <!--List Numbered Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ol class="ast-list__numbered">
        <li class="ast-list__numbered__item">
          <div class="ast-list__numbered__item__div">
            that the defendant (usually the employer) owed him a duty of care
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__numbered__item">
          <div class="ast-list__numbered__item__div">
            that this duty was breached
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__numbered__item">
          <div class="ast-list__numbered__item__div">
            that the claimant suffered a legally recognisable loss as a result
            of the breach.

      </ol>

    <p>
      Therefore it can be seen that the defence would be successful if it can
      disprove any of the above.

      An employer will not be liable for an injury if he does not owe a duty of
      care to the injured person.

            the claimant was the wife of a lorry driver employed to transport
            lead oxide. When cleaning her husband’s work clothes she banged his
            overalls against a garden wall and banged dust off his boots. As a
            result of inhaling lead oxide dust she suffered from lead poisoning
            and sued her husband’s employers for personal injuries suffered.
          </p>
          <p>
            The action was dismissed as the husbands occupational exposure did
            not put him at risk it was not foreseeable that the wife would be at
            risk.

      It was accepted that if there was a foreseeable risk to the family of an
      employee from contaminated work clothing, etc. then the employers owed a
      duty of care to those family members.

    <p>
      Contributory negligence is more a means of mitigating against the costs of
      paying damages, rather than a true defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 provides that if a
      person is injured, partly because of his own fault, and partly due to the
      fault of another, damages should be reduced in proportion to the
      claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employers often argue that even if they were negligent, the employee
      failed to take care for his own safety and that the damages awarded should
      be reduced accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no objective or scientific basis for determining the percentage
      reduction.

            a machine minder lost an arm when he leaned across a revolving

            It was held that the employer was liable, as the machinery should
            have been properly guarded, but the employee’s damages were reduced
            by 80% to account for his own contributory negligence.
