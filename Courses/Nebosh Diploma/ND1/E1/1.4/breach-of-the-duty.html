      The basic rule is that the defendant must conform to the standard of care
      expected of a reasonable person.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <span class="ast-bold">Blythe v Birmingham Waterworks (1856)</span> it
      was held that:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man guided
        upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human
        affairs, would do, or doing something which a reasonable and prudent man
        would not do.

      The behaviour of an ordinary person, in ordinary circumstances, (not
      involving special skill or knowledge) was considered by the House of Lords
      in <span class="ast-bold">Glasgow Corporation v Muir (1943).</span> Two
      important aspects of the test were highlighted:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the standard of foresight of the reasonable man is an impersonal,
          objective test, independent of the idiosyncrasies of the individual
          concerned. The actual defendant is judged by this abstract, impersonal
          standard, even though he may be more ignorant or stupid, or cleverer
          or more knowledgeable
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          it is down to the judge to determine what, in the circumstances of the
          particular case, the reasonable man would have had in contemplation.
          So there is room for diversity of views and outcomes are, to an
          extent, unpredictable.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">

    <p>
      Normally the burden of establishing that the defendant has breached his
      duty of care rests with the claimant. However in some cases the factual
      chain of events established by the claimant is said to
      <span class="ast-italic">‘speak for itself’,</span>
      i.e. there is a presumption that the event could not have happened unless
      the defendant had been negligent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burden is then put on the defendant to explain the accident, and to
      show that there was no want of care on his part, i.e. the accident was
      caused by the fault of a third party.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The basic rule for determining whether or not a breach caused the loss may
      be stated positively or negatively:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          if the damage would still have occurred, even if the defendant had not
          broken the duty of care, then the breach did not cause the damage
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          if the damage would not have occurred but for the defendant’s breach
          of duty, then the breach of duty is a cause of the damage.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The rule is also referred to as the
      <span class="ast-bold">‘but for’</span> test. It is designed to exclude
      things that have no bearing on the damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is for the claimant to show that the breach of duty was the cause of
      the damage, and not for the defendant to show that the breach of duty was
      not the cause of the damage.

            In
            <span class="ast-bold">Corr v IBC (Vehicles) Ltd (2008)</span> the
            House of Lords considered the remoteness of damage when Mr. Corr
            committed suicide as a consequence of severe physical and
            psychological injuries caused by an accident at work. It was held
            that the chain of causation from the accident to the physical and
            psychological injuries, to depression and ultimately suicide was
            uninterrupted.

            <span class="ast-bold"
              >Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services (2002)</span
            >
            Mr Fairchild had worked for several contractors in his career, all
            of whom had negligently exposed him to asbestos fibres. Mr Fairchild
            then contracted pleural mesothelioma.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was not possible to show which employer was responsible for
            exposing him to the single fibre which caused his illness. The
            <span class="ast-italic">‘but for’</span> test was inadequate in the
            circumstances. The House of Lords approved a new test of
            <span class="ast-italic">‘materially increasing risk’</span> to be
            used in such circumstances together with the notion of proportionate
            liability.
