      Section 1(1) of the Employer’s Liability (Defective Equipment) Act 1969
      reversed the decision of the House of Lords in Davie v New Merton Board
      Mills (1959) to make an employer liable if an employee suffers personal

      The employer (most likely the insurance company) will then pursue the

      contributed to the cause of the accident and injury, a claim of
      contributory negligence may also be made.

      The employer is responsible for the overall planning of work operations to
      ensure they can be carried out safely. This includes: the layout of the

      The more dangerous the process, the greater is the need to ensure that it
      is safe. On the other hand, the employer cannot be expected to take
      over-elaborate precautions when dealing with simple and obvious dangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the employers duty to provide is passive (provide only) or active
      (compel use) has been extensively considered by the courts. The position
      can be explained through four propositions:

          it was held that if the risk is an obvious one, and the injury which
          may result from the failure to use the precautions is not likely to be
          serious, then the employer’s duty is a mere passive one of providing
          the necessary precautions, informing the employees of their presence,
          and leaving it to them to decide whether or not to use them

            The employer was not held liable, as the injury occurred through an
