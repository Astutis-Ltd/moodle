    <p>
      The tort of vicarious liability arises when one person (who has not
      committed a wrongful act) is legally liable for the acts of another
      person, which cause injury or damage to a third person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vicarious liability arises because the actual wrongdoer (a co-worker, for
      example) is unlikely to have sufficient financial resources to meet any
      claim, and so the injured party will seek to make the first person (the
      employer, for example) vicariously liable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general principle of an employer’s vicarious liability is that the
      employer is liable for the acts of his employee which injure a third party
      if the employee, when doing the act, was acting in the course of his
      employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vicarious liability has been shown to exist even where the employer has
      expressly prohibited an employee from doing the act in question
      <span class="ast-bold">(Rose v Plenty (1976)).</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In <span class="ast-bold">Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd. (2002),</span> a sex
      abuse case in a children’s home, a new test was formulated to address
      events where an employee commits an unauthorised or prohibited act.
    </p>
    <p>
      The test asks:
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >Were the acts so closely connected with the employment that it would be
        fair and just to hold the employer liable?</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently earlier cases defended on the basis that the employee was on
      a frolic of his own must be treated with caution if there is a degree of
      connection with the employment. Vicarious liability is now appearing in a
      number of different areas of employment law, including sex discrimination
      and race discrimination.
    </p>
    <p>
      An employer is not generally liable for the wrongful acts of an
      independent contractor. However, an employer may be liable if he:

            Case law In the case of
            <span class="ast-bold"
              >Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Coggins and Griffith (Liverpool)
              Ltd. (1946)</span
            >
            a stevedore company, Coggins and Griffith, hired a crane with its
            driver from Mersey Docks and Harbour Board. The nature of the
            contract was such that the driver was the servant of Coggins and
            Griffith, and would be instructed by them but Mersey Docks and
            Harbour Board continued to pay his wages and had the power to
            dismiss him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The House of Lords was required to determine which of the two
            parties could be held vicariously liable for the negligent act of
            the crane driver, which injured a third party.
          </p>
          <p>
            The House of Lords held that Mersey Docks and Harbour Board remained
            vicariously liable for the crane driver’s negligence. He was using
            his own discretion in operating the crane and this was deemed to
            have been delegated to him by Mersey Docks and Harbour Board.
          </p>
          <p>
            The power to control the method of performing the work had not been
            transferred to Coggins and Griffith, and Coggins and Griffith had no
            control over the way he operated the crane.
          </p>

            In
            <span class="ast-bold"
              >Viasystems (Tyneside) Ltd v Thermal Transfer (Northern) Ltd and
              others (2005)</span
            >
            the Court of Appeal held that dual vicarious liability can apply in
            an employment situation. Viasystems suffered flood damage when a
            fitters mate (Mr. Strang) installing air conditioning ducting
            negligently activated the fire protection sprinkler system.
            Viasystems had contracted Thermal Transfer to install the air
            conditioning and Thermal Transfer subcontracted to Darwell who
            subcontracted CAT to provide labourers, fitters and fitters mates.
            Mr Strang was receiving instructions from both a CAT fitter (Mr.
            Megson) and a Darwell supervisor (Mr Horsley). CAT and Darwell were
            found to be jointly vicariously liable.
