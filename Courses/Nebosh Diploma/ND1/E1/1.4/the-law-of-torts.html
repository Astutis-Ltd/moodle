    <p>
      The law of torts is concerned with the redress of injuries or other wrongs
      (not including breaches of contract) by means of a civil action by the
      victim, typically with the aim of obtaining financial compensation
      ‘damages’ for the losses incurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many torts including trespass, nuisance and defamation. Of
      particular relevance with regard to obtaining ‘damages’ for injuries
      arising out of work are:

      As an injured employee (the claimant) is entitled to sue for damages under
      both negligence and Tort of Breach of Statutory Duty (TBSD),
      <span class="ast-italic">‘double-barrelled’</span> actions have become
      commonplace. The claimant sues the employer (defendant) separately but
      simultaneously for both breaches.
      <span class="ast-italic">Note:</span> only one award of damages will be
      made.
