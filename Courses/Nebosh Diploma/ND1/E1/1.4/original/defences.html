            In <strong>Hewett v Alf Brown’s Transport Ltd. (1992)</strong> the
            claimant was the wife of a lorry driver employed to transport lead
            oxide. When cleaning her husband’s work clothes she banged his
            overalls against a garden wall and banged dust off his boots. As a
            result of inhaling lead oxide dust she suffered from lead poisoning
            and sued her husband’s employers for personal injuries suffered.
          </p>
          <p>
            The action was dismissed as the husbands occupational exposure did
            not put him at risk it was not foreseeable that the wife would be at
            risk.

      It was accepted that if there was a foreseeable risk to the family of an
      employee from contaminated work clothing, <em>etc</em>. then the employers
      owed a duty of care to those family members.

            In <strong>Smith v Baker and Sons (1891)</strong> the employer
            pleaded volenti against an employee injured by a falling rock whilst
            drilling rock in a cutting beneath a crane.
          </p>
          <p>
            The court held that although the employee knew of the danger and
            continued to work, he had not voluntarily undertaken the risk of a
            stone falling from the crane and hitting him.

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Fault of a third party</strong></p>

      An employer will not be liable if the injury is caused by a new

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Contributory negligence</strong></p>
    <p>
      Contributory negligence is more a means of mitigating against the costs of
      paying damages, rather than a true defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 provides that if a
      person is injured, partly because of his own fault, and partly due to the
      fault of another, damages should be reduced in proportion to the
      claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employers often argue that even if they were negligent, the employee
      failed to take care for his own safety and that the damages awarded should
      be reduced accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no objective or scientific basis for determining the percentage
      reduction.
