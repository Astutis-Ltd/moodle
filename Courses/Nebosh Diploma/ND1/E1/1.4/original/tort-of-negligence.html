    <p>
      Negligence may be explained as careless conduct injuring another. In legal
      terms it was defined by Lord Wright in
      <strong>Lochgelly Iron and Coal Co. v McMullan (1934)</strong>.

    <p>
      Prior to 1932 there was no generalised duty of care in negligence. The
      tort was only applied in particular situations where the courts had
      decided that a duty should be owed, such as road accidents or dangerous
      goods.

            In <strong>Donoghue v Stevenson (1932)</strong>&nbsp;Lord Atkin
            attempted to lay down a general principle which would&nbsp;cover all
            the circumstances where there could be liability for negligence. He
            said:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >"You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which
              you can reasonably foresee&nbsp;would be likely to injure your
              neighbour. Who, then, in law is my neighbour? The answer
              seems&nbsp;to be – persons who are so closely and directly
              affected by my act that I ought reasonably to&nbsp;have them in
              contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to

    <p>
      The standard of care required was defined in
      <strong>Paris v Stepney Borough Council</strong
      ><strong> (1951) </strong>as
      <em
        >the care which an ordinary prudent employer would take in all the

    </p>
    <p>
      What is reasonable will vary with context, and with the characteristics of
      the individual to whom the duty is owed. In general, a greater level of
      care must be taken of more vulnerable individuals, such as children or
      disabled persons.

            In <strong>Paris v Stepney Borough Council (1951) </strong>the House
            of Lords held that where a workman had a disability which increased
            the risk of serious injury, if he was injured in an accident, the
            special risk of injury was a relevant consideration in determining
            the precautions the employer should take to fulfil his duty of care
            to the workman.

          <p>
            In <strong>Yachuk v. Oliver Blais Co. (1949)</strong> a nine year
            old boy lied to a petrol station attendant to obtain a container of
            petrol. The boy claimed his mother’s car had run out of fuel, but he
            actually wanted it to light a bonfire. The boy was injured in an
            explosion when lighting the petrol soaked timber.
          </p>
          <p>
            The court held that the petrol station attendant was negligent in
            selling the petrol to the child, and that he owed a greater duty of
            care to a child than an adult when selling petrol.

            In the case of <strong>Latimer v AEC Ltd. (1953)</strong>, a factory
            floor was flooded after an unusually heavy rainfall. After the flood
            subsided the floor was left slippery, so was treated with sawdust.
            There was not enough sawdust to treat the whole floor, so it was
            used where the need was felt to be greatest. Subsequently Latimer
            slipped on an untreated section of floor and was injured.
          </p>
          <p>
            AEC Ltd was held to have taken reasonable precautions and exercised
            reasonable care.

      If harm cannot be foreseen, the defendant cannot be held liable for it. In

            In <strong>Joseph v Ministry of Defence (1980)</strong> a man who
            developed symptoms of vibration induced white finger after working
            as a caulker/riveter for many years, failed in his claim for
            damages.

          <p>
            The Court of Appeal held that in 1973 when the complaint arose

            In<strong> British Coal v Armstrong and Others (1996)</strong> the
            Court of Appeal held that British Coal should have recognised by
            1973 that the work undertaken by the claimants gave rise to

            precautions by 1976.

            it was held that after the Ministry of Labour published Noise and

            In the case of
            <strong>Kapfunde v Abbey National and Daniel (1998)</strong>, Dr
            Daniel was a GP retained by Abbey National to provide medical
            services, including pre-employment assessments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ms Kapfunde was refused a permanent position with Abbey National on
            the basis of Dr Daniel’s advice that, as a sickle cell anaemia
            sufferer, she was likely to have a higher than average level of
            absence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ms Kapfunde argued that Dr Daniels owed her a duty of care in
            relation to the information she had provided concerning her sickness
            record, and that he had over-assessed the risk of her being off work
            due to illness related to sickle cell.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Court of Appeal held that Dr Daniel’s relationship was with
            Abbey National and he did not have a sufficiently proximate
            relationship with Ms Kapfunde to owe her a duty of care.

      The common law duty of care owed by an employer to its employees was
      defined in the case of
      <strong>Wilson’s and Clyde Coal Co. v English (1938)</strong>. In this
      case, the employer was compelled by law to employ a colliery agent who was
      in charge of safety in the mine. Nonetheless, when an accident occurred,
      the employer was held liable. The case confirmed that the employer’s duty
      of care to his employees was personal, and could not be delegated to a
      manager or safety advisor.

    <p>The case also determined that employers must provide:</p>
