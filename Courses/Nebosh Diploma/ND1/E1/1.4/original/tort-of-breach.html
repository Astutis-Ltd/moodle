      <h2 style="padding-top: 24px">Tort of breach of statutory duty<br /></h2>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      The courts have considered at length whether or not a person, injured as a
      consequence of the failure of another to perform a statutory duty, could
      bring a civil action based on that failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courts have generally held that action can be taken for the tort of
      breach of statutory duty (TBSD) in relation to occupational health and
      safety legislation, although there are notable exceptions and it cannot be
      presumed that all breaches of statutory duty will be actionable in civil
      courts. This will depend upon the purposes and objects of the statute in
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      To bring a successful action under the Tort of Breach of Statutory Duty
      (TBSD) the claimant must show five things:

            In <strong>Ricketts v Torbay Council (2003)</strong> Mrs Ricketts

            In <strong>Corn v Weir Glass (Hanley) Ltd. (1960)</strong> a glazier
            was carrying a sheet of glass down a stairway 5 feet 6 inches wide,
            which had no guard rail, when he fell from a height of between two
            and three feet sustaining injuries.
          </p>
          <p>
            The courts debated the meanings of guard rail and hand rail under
            Regulation 27 of the Building (Safety, Health and Welfare)
            Regulations 1948 and held there was no breach of statutory duty, as
            he would not have been able to use a hand rail and that the function
            of a hand rail was not to protect against falling as per a guard
            rail.

            In <strong>Fytche v Wincanton Logistics plc (2004)</strong> the
            claimant was employed to drive a 32-tonne articulated bulk dairy
            tanker. In wintry conditions in December 1999 the tanker got stuck
            on an icy country road. Rather than follow company procedures to
            telephone and wait for help, Mr Fytche decided to dig the tanker
            out. After about three hours working in the snow he was able to
            drive off. One of Mr Fytches boots leaked through a tiny hole next
            to the little toe and he suffered frostbite as a result. He brought
            an action for damages, alleging a breach of Regulation 7 of the
            Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992.
          </p>
          <p>
            His claim failed. The obligation imposed on an employer to maintain
            and repair personal protective equipment, under Regulation 7(1) of
            the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992 related
            purely to the risk in relation to which the equipment was supplied.
          </p>
          <p>
            The boots were provided to protect against the risk of injury to
            feet from a milk churn.

            In <strong>Close v Steel Company of Wales (1962)</strong> a worker
            was injured by a piece of machinery that flew out of a machine. He
            brought an action for a breach of Section 14 of the Factories Act
            1961 – the duty to fence dangerous parts of machinery.
          </p>
          <p>
            The claim failed. Section 14 was intended to prevent the worker from
            coming into contact with the machine, not to stop parts of the
            machine from being thrown at the worker.

            In <strong>Furness v Midland Bank plc (2000)</strong> the claimant
            (an employee) slipped and fell on water on a half-landing of a
            flight of internal stairs leading down to a basement area.

          <p>
            Only a few droplets of water were found after the accident and
            nobody could explain where it had come from, or how long it had been

            leakage or spillages.
          </p>
          <p>
            The claimant alleged a breach of the Workplace (Health, Safety and
            Welfare) Regulations 1992, Regulation 12(3), which requires
            <em
              >so far as is reasonably practicable, every floor in a workplace

          </p>
          <p>
            The claim was dismissed as the degree of risk arising from the
            spillage was very small and the only way to protect against it would
            have been totally&nbsp; disproportionate to the risks involved.

            In <strong>Griffiths v Vauxhall Motors Ltd. (2003)</strong> it was
            held that if an accident occurs and no risk assessment has been
            carried out, it is reasonable to conclude that the breach was in
            some way responsible for the accident or injury.

            In
            <strong>McWilliams v Sir William Arrol &amp; Co Ltd. (1962)</strong
            >, a steel erector fell seventy feet from a steel tower in the
            building of which he was assisting and was killed. The employers
            provided safety belts for steel erectors on site but as they were
            not being used, they were taken to another site. His widow sued for
            a breach of Section 26(2) of the Factories Act 1937 for failing to
            provide a safety belt.
          </p>
          <p>
            The House of Lords held that the employer was not liable in damages
            because the breach of duty was not the cause of the damage suffered
            since (a) on the evidence the deceased would not have worn a safety
            belt if it had been provided, and (b) there was no duty on the
            employers to instruct or exhort the deceased to wear a safety belt.

      The recent <span><em>‘pleural plaques’ </em></span>cases (for
      example,&nbsp;<strong>Grieves v FT Everard and Sons (2005)</strong>)
      raised an interesting point regarding what constitutes actionable damage.
      The presence of pleural plaques (areas of scar tissues on the membrane
      surrounding the lung) did not, by itself, justify an award of compensation
      as pleural plaques are symptomless and have no adverse effect on the body.
      The fact of the potential for future damage also failed to justify an
      award.

            In <strong>Corn v Weir’s Glass (Hanley) Ltd. (1960)</strong> Mr Corn
            was a glazier who fell off a stairwell while carrying a pane of

            The case has an interesting discussion regarding the difference
            between hand rails and guard rails and whether or not the presence
            of the hand rail would have prevented the accident.
