            In <strong>Barcock v Brighton Corporation (1949) </strong>the
            claimant was employed at an electric substation. A certain method of
            testing was in operation which was unsafe and, in consequence, the
            employee was injured.The employers were held liable for failing to
            provide suitable plant.

      The more dangerous the process, the greater is the need to ensure that it
      is safe. On the other hand, the employer cannot be expected to take
      over-elaborate precautions when dealing with simple and obvious dangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the employers duty to provide is passive (provide only) or active
      (compel use) has been extensively considered by the courts. The position
      can be explained through four propositions:

          </p>
          <p>
            The employer was not held liable, as the injury occurred through an
