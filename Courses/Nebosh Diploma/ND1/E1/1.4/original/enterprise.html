    <p>
      The Lofstedt Report 2011 identified potential unfairness where health and
      safety at work regulations impose a strict liability on employers, making
      them legally responsible to pay compensation despite having done all that
      was reasonable to protect their employees, and recommended that regulatory
      provisions which impose strict liability should be reviewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its response to the report the Government has introduced the Enterprise
      and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 (ERRA). Section 69 (Civil liability for
      breach of health and safety duties) of the ERRA amends Section 47(2) of
      the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 removing the right to sue using the
      tort of breach of statutory duty (unless the health and safety provision
      in question specifically provides for a civil right of action).
    </p>
    <p>
      This leaves claimants having to rely more frequently on proving an
      employerâ€™s negligence (breach of the common law duty of care).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (Civil Liability) (Exceptions)
      Regulations 2013 has since amended Regulation 22 of the Management of
      Health and Safety at Work Regulations to allow new or expectant mothers to
      sue for damages caused by breaches of Regulations 16, 16A, 17 or 17A.
