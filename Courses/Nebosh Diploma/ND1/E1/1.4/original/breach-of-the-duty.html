      The basic rule is that the defendant must conform to the standard of care
      expected of a reasonable person.

      In <strong>Blythe v Birmingham Waterworks (1856)</strong> it was held

      The behaviour of an ordinary person, in ordinary circumstances, (not
      involving special skill or knowledge) was considered by the House of Lords
      in<strong> Glasgow Corporation v Muir (1943)</strong>. Two important
      aspects of the test were highlighted:

      Normally the burden of establishing that the defendant has breached his
      duty of care rests with the claimant. However in some cases the factual
      chain of events established by the claimant is said to
      <em>‘speak for itself’</em>, i.e. there is a presumption that the event
      could not have happened unless the defendant had been negligent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burden is then put on the defendant to explain the accident, and to
      show that there was no want of care on his part, i.e. the accident was
      caused by the fault of a third party.

            In <strong>Corr v IBC (Vehicles) Ltd (2008)</strong> the House of
            Lords considered the remoteness of damage when Mr. Corr committed
            suicide as a consequence of severe physical and psychological
            injuries caused by an accident at work. It was held that the chain
            of causation from the accident to the physical and psychological
            injuries, to depression and ultimately suicide was uninterrupted.

            In <strong>Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services (2002)</strong> Mr
            Fairchild had worked for several contractors in his career, all of
            whom had negligently exposed him to asbestos fibres. Mr Fairchild
            then contracted pleural mesothelioma.

            It was not possible to show which employer was responsible for
            exposing him to the single fibre which caused his illness. The
            <em>‘but for’</em> test was inadequate in the
            circumstances.&nbsp;<span
