    <p>
      Unlike England and Wales where the statutory duty of care owed to invited
      visitors is greater than the level of care owed to trespassers, in
      Scotland there is no distinction and the same duty of care is owed to all
      persons entering the premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occupier is required to take reasonable care to ensure that a person
      on the premises does not suffer injury or damage caused by the state of
      the premises or by anything done or not done to the premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is reasonable will depend on the circumstances of the case, and is
      generally regarded as what a <em>‘reasonable person’</em> would consider
      to be reasonable in the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occupier is not normally expected to guard against dangers which are
      obvious and has no obligations regarding risks which are willingly
      accepted by the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 1960 Act does not specifically refer to the duties owed to children.
      However, certain dangers will be less obvious to children than to adults,
      and this will need to be taken into account in the level of care shown.
      <em>Note: </em>the principal duty in relation to very young children
      remains with their parents.

      Section 3 of the Act is titled landlord’s liability by virtue of
      responsibility for repairs. Section 3 makes it clear that where the
      landlord is responsible for the maintenance or repair of the premises, the
      landlord is liable for harm to any persons on the premises or their
      property kept on the premises arising from a failure to maintain the
      premises in good repair.<br />
