    <p>
      <strong>Occupiers’ liability </strong>concerns liability for damage to
      ‘others’ on occupiers’ property, where an occupier (for tort purposes) is
      someone who has sufficient control of premises (including fixed or
      moveable structures) to justify the duties being imposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A landlord may not be an occupier if the premise is let, whereas a
      principal contractor on a construction site may well be an occupier, even
      if he has no legal interest in the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically occupiers’ liability law developed separately to the law of
      negligence and recognised two categories of person that an occupier owed a
      duty to, <em>i.e.</em> invitees and licensees.

      The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 was introduced to address confusion
      within the common law of occupiers’ liability, and remodelled the law
      along the lines of general negligence so that visitors were owed a common
      duty of care:

        >
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      The Occupiers’ Liability Act did not affect the duty to trespassers, i.e.
      any person who is on the premises unlawfully, without the express or
      implied consent of the occupier. The common law duty to trespassers
      remained, to not deliberately or recklessly cause injury, though
      reasonable force could be used to expel a trespasser.

          <p>
            In <strong>Addy and Sons v Dumbreck (1929) </strong>the House of
            Lords had decided that an occupier of premises was only liable to a
            trespassing child if that child was injured by the occupier
            intentionally or recklessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <strong>Herrington v British Railways Board (BRB) 1972 </strong>a
            six year old gained access to the railway via a dilapidated fence
            (broken by trespassers who regularly crossed the line) and was
            injured by an electrified rail. The defendant knew children had been
            seen on the land in the past but had not repaired the fence.
          </p>
          <p>
            The House of Lords overruled the Addy decision, changing the law in
            line with the changes to social and physical conditions that had
            occurred since 1929. They felt that even a trespasser was entitled
            to some degree of care, which it propounded as a test of
            <em>‘common humanity’.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Court of Appeal held that BRB was in breach of its duty of care
            and therefore liable: The duty owed was…to take such steps as common
            sense or common humanity would dictate.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <br />

    <p>
      The <strong>duty of common humanity</strong> required consideration of all
      the surrounding circumstances, for example, the seriousness of the danger,
      the type of trespasser likely to enter, and in some cases the resources of
      the occupier.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to differentiate from the general common law duty of care,
      although the standard probably requires a higher degree of likelihood of
      harm, and the circumstances and available resources of the occupier are
      considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courts had a major difficulty in striking a balance between the rights
      of landowners and the rights of the unintentional trespasser, who is
      injured as a result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 1(4) of the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 replaced the duty of
      common humanity with a duty to:

    <br />

    <p>
      The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 does not significantly change the common
      law position regarding trespassers. All the circumstances of the cases
      remain relevant, including what the occupier does know and ought to know,
      both about the existence of the danger and the likelihood of trespassers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very unlikely that Herrington’s case would be decided differently
      under the 1984 Occupiers’ Liability Act.
