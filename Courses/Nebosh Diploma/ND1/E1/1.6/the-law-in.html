    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Occupiers’ liability</span> concerns liability for
      damage to ‘others’ on occupiers’ property, where an occupier (for tort
      purposes) is someone who has sufficient control of premises (including
      fixed or moveable structures) to justify the duties being imposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A landlord may not be an occupier if the premise is let, whereas a
      principal contractor on a construction site may well be an occupier, even
      if he has no legal interest in the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically occupiers’ liability law developed separately to the law of
      negligence and recognised two categories of person that an occupier owed a
      duty to, i.e. invitees and licensees.

    <p>
      The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 was introduced to address confusion
      within the common law of occupiers’ liability, and remodelled the law
      along the lines of general negligence so that visitors were owed a common
      duty of care:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        Duty to take such care as is reasonable to see that the visitor will be
        reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is
        invited or permitted to be there.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      The Occupiers’ Liability Act did not affect the duty to trespassers, i.e.
      any person who is on the premises unlawfully, without the express or
      implied consent of the occupier. The common law duty to trespassers
      remained, to not deliberately or recklessly cause injury, though
      reasonable force could be used to expel a trespasser.

            In <span class="ast-bold">Addy and Sons v Dumbreck (1929)</span> the
            House of Lords had decided that an occupier of premises was only
            liable to a trespassing child if that child was injured by the
            occupier intentionally or recklessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            In
            <span class="ast-bold"
              >Herrington v British Railways Board (BRB) 1972</span
            >
            a six year old gained access to the railway via a dilapidated fence
            (broken by trespassers who regularly crossed the line) and was
            injured by an electrified rail. The defendant knew children had been
            seen on the land in the past but had not repaired the fence.
          </p>
          <p>
            The House of Lords overruled the Addy decision, changing the law in
            line with the changes to social and physical conditions that had
            occurred since 1929. They felt that even a trespasser was entitled
            to some degree of care, which it propounded as a test of
            <span class="ast-italic">‘common humanity’.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Court of Appeal held that BRB was in breach of its duty of care
            and therefore liable: The duty owed was…to take such steps as common
            sense or common humanity would dictate.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!--Case Law End-->

    <p>
      The <span class="ast-bold">duty of common humanity</span> required
      consideration of all the surrounding circumstances, for example, the
      seriousness of the danger, the type of trespasser likely to enter, and in
      some cases the resources of the occupier.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to differentiate from the general common law duty of care,
      although the standard probably requires a higher degree of likelihood of
      harm, and the circumstances and available resources of the occupier are
      considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courts had a major difficulty in striking a balance between the rights
      of landowners and the rights of the unintentional trespasser, who is
      injured as a result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 1(4) of the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 replaced the duty of
      common humanity with a duty to:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        …take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances of the case to
        ensure that the trespasser is not injured by the state of or anything on
        the premises.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>Under Section 1(3) the trespasser is owed duty if:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the occupier is aware of the danger or has reasonable grounds to be
          aware
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the occupier knows, or has reasonable grounds to know that the
          trespasser is, or may be in the vicinity of the danger
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the risk is one from which the occupier may reasonably be expected to
          offer some protection.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 does not significantly change the common
      law position regarding trespassers. All the circumstances of the cases
      remain relevant, including what the occupier does know and ought to know,
      both about the existence of the danger and the likelihood of trespassers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very unlikely that Herrington’s case would be decided differently
      under the 1984 Occupiers’ Liability Act.
