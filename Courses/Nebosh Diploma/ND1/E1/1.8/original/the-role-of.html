    <p>
      Traditionally, a Claim Handler handles the processes of a claim. They can
      normally agree to payouts within a very limited set of internal rules and
      have to refer anything unusual to a colleague with a greater level of
      authority, such as a loss adjuster.

    <p>
      A <em>"Loss Adjuster“&nbsp;</em>is generally empowered to<em>
        “adjust the loss”</em
      >
      which means they act with full authority of the insurer to negotiate and
      settle a claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loss adjusters are independent experts who are usually employed by
      insurance companies to resolve complex claims, although they may just
      provide guidance and recommendations to the insurers.

    <p>The loss adjusters role typically involves:</p>

    <p>
      Where the loss adjuster is acting on behalf of an insurer there will
      usually be strict service level agreements to help ensure that the claim
      is dealt with efficiently and fairly.

      Chartered Loss Adjusters are experienced claims professionals who have
      achieved the highest qualification in claims handling. They are members of
      the Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters (CILA) and are therefore bound
      to behave in accordance with the CILA Guide to Professional Conduct.
