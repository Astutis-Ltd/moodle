      If a business has employees then it is likely to be required by law for
      the organisation to have employers’ liability insurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an employee is injured or becomes ill as a result of the work they do
      for their employer, they can claim compensation from the employer.
      However, if it is found that the organisation is liable, employers’
      liability insurance will pay any compensation for employees’ injuries or
      illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an organisation takes out employers’ liability insurance, they will
      have an agreement with their insurer about the circumstances in which the
      insurer will pay compensation. For example, the policy will cover the
      specific activities that relate to the business. If however, the insurer
      believes that the employer has failed to meet their legal responsibilities
      for the health and safety of their employees and that this has led to the
      claim, the policy may enable the insurer to sue the employer to reclaim
      the cost of the compensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a few businesses are not required to have employers’ liability
      insurance. If they have no employees, or are a family business and all
      employees are closely related to the owner, they may not need it. The
      Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969 lays down the
      requirements for the insurance and where it is required.
    </p>
    <p>The following employers are exempt:</p>

    <p>
      The cover provided by employer’s liability insurance must be for at least
      £5 million. However, organisations, after looking at their risks and
      liabilities, may choose to take out more than £5 million cover. In
      practice, most insurers offer cover of at least £10 million. Employer’s
      must display a copy of the certificate of insurance where employees can
      easily read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organisations can be fined if they do not hold a current employers’
      liability insurance policy which complies with the law.
    </p>

      <p>Public liability</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Public liability insurance is different from employer’s liability. It
      covers organisations for claims made against them by members of the public
      or other businesses, but not for claims by employees. While public
      liability insurance is generally voluntary, employers’ liability insurance
      is compulsory. Organisations can be fined if they do not hold a current
      employers’ liability insurance policy which complies with the law.
