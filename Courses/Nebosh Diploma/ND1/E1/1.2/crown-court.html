    <p>
      The Crown Court hears indictable offences and those cases (usually of a
      more serious nature) that the prosecution or defence have elected to have
      tried before the Crown Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cases in the Crown Court are heard before a judge and jury. The judgeâ€™s
      role is to ensure that the trial is conducted fairly, and to sum up for
      the jury on points of law. The jury is responsible for returning a verdict
      depending on the facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      An appeal against conviction and / or sentence will go to the Court of
      Appeal
