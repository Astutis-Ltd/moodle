    <p>
      The <span class="ast-bold">High Court of Justiciary</span> is Scotland’s
      supreme criminal court. When sitting at first instance as a trial court,
      it hears the most serious criminal cases, such as murder and rape. A
      single judge hears cases with a jury of 15 people. At first instance, it
      sits in cities and larger towns around Scotland, but as an appeal court,
      it sits mostly in Edinburgh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The High Court hears criminal appeals from first instance cases from the
      High Court itself, sheriff courts and justice of the peace courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of cases are dealt with in the country’s
      <span class="ast-bold">sheriff courts</span>. Criminal cases are heard by
      a sheriff and a jury (solemn procedure), but can be heard by a sheriff
      alone (summary procedure).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="ast-bold">Sheriff Appeal Court</span> was established in
      2015 to hear appeals arising out of summary criminal proceedings from both
      the sheriff and justice of the peace courts. The bench generally comprises
      two or three appeal sheriffs, depending on the type of appeal to be
      considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less serious criminal matters are heard in
      <span class="ast-bold">justice of the peace courts</span> at first
      instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-italic">Note:</span> in Scotland criminal proceedings are
      brought by the procurator fiscal rather than the enforcement agencies.
      Once the HSE or local authority inspector (EHO) has conducted an
      investigation and gathered evidence the file is passed to the procurator
      fiscal who determines whether or not to proceed.

      <span class="ast-italic">Note:</span> Employment tribunals and employment
      appeals tribunals operate in Scotland in the same way as in England and
      Wales, under the auspices of HM Courts and Tribunal Service. There is a
      Scottish Employment Tribunal Customer Contact Centre in Glasgow.
