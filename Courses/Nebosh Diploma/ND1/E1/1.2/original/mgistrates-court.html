    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      Magistrates or Justices of the Peace (JPs) are generally non-lawyers
      appointed by the Lord Chancellor on the recommendation of a local advisory
      committee with the aim of ensuring that the ‘bench’ is balanced with
      representatives from a wide cross-section of the local community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magistrates typically sit in benches of three and, although advised on
      points of law by a legally qualified clerk, have responsibility for
      determining the facts of the case and making a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full-time district judges (formerly known as stipendiary magistrates) also
      hear cases in a magistrates’ court. A district judge will usually sit
      alone, whereas lay magistrates will normally sit in benches of three.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magistrates’ court has some civil jurisdiction but most of its work
      relates to criminal cases. Over 94% of criminal cases (mainly motoring
      offences and petty crimes) are heard in the magistrates’ courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magistrates’ courts have a role to play in hearing summary offences,
      indictable offences and offences <em>‘triable either way’</em>:

        <strong>Indictable offences </strong>are heard before a judge and jury
        in the Crown Court, although proceedings begin in the magistrates’
        court, where the magistrates determine if&nbsp;there is sufficient
        evidence to commit the accused to the Crown Court for trial. These are
        known as committal proceedings.

        Cases that are <strong>triable either way</strong>, depending on the

      Some health and safety offences are summary, but many under the Health and
      Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 are triable either way, depending on the
      seriousness of the offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appeals against conviction and / or sentence from the magistrates court
      may be made by the accused to the Crown Court, and will take the form of a
      rehearing before a judge (without a jury).
    </p>
    <p>
      Appeals from the magistrates’ court on a point of law may be made by the
      defence or accused and are done by way of ‘case stated’ to the High Court,
      or more specifically the Divisional Court of the Queens’ Bench Division of
      the High Court. An appeal by way of case stated is limited to appeals
      relating to matters of law i.e. where it is argued that the Magistrates or
      District Judge were wrong in how they applied the law or that they acted
      in excess of their jurisdiction.
