    <p>
      The <strong>High Court of Justiciary</strong> is Scotland’s supreme
      criminal court. When sitting at first instance as a trial court, it hears
      the most serious criminal cases, such as murder and rape. A single judge
      hears cases with a jury of 15 people. At first instance, it sits in cities
      and larger towns around Scotland, but as an appeal court, it sits mostly
      in Edinburgh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The High Court hears criminal appeals from first instance cases from the
      High Court itself, sheriff courts and justice of the peace courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of cases are dealt with in the country’s
      <strong>sheriff courts</strong>. Criminal cases are heard by a sheriff and
      a jury (solemn procedure), but can be heard by a sheriff alone (summary
      procedure).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Sheriff Appeal Court</strong> was established in 2015 to hear
      appeals arising out of summary criminal proceedings from both the sheriff
      and justice of the peace courts. The bench generally comprises two or
      three appeal sheriffs, depending on the type of appeal to be considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less serious criminal matters are heard in
      <strong>justice of the peace courts</strong> at first instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> in Scotland criminal proceedings are brought by the
      procurator fiscal rather than the enforcement agencies. Once the HSE or
      local authority inspector (EHO) has conducted an investigation and
      gathered evidence the file is passed to the procurator fiscal who
      determines whether or not to proceed.

      <em>Note:</em> Employment tribunals and employment appeals tribunals
      operate in Scotland in the same way as in England and Wales, under the
      auspices of HM Courts and Tribunal Service. There is a Scottish Employment
      Tribunal Customer Contact Centre in Glasgow.
