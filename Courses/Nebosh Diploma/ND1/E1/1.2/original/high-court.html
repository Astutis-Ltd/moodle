    <p>
      The Queen’s Bench Division (QBD) deals with civil cases involving things
      like contracts and negligence but can also hear appeals from lower courts.
      When sitting in that capacity, the court is called a
      <em>‘Divisional Court of the High Court’</em>. The Divisional Courts hear
      appeals from courts and tribunals below them in the hierarchy.

        appeals by way of ‘case stated’ from the decisions of the magistrates’
        courts. The High Court has wide-ranging powers and may reverse the
        decision appealed against, affirm it or amend it. The High Court can
        also send the case back to the Magistrates’ Court with its opinion on
        the point of law concerned which the Magistrates or District Judge would
        then have to apply to the case in question

    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> Appeals against enforcement notices go to the Queen’s Bench
      Division rather than the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) because failure
      to comply with an enforcement notice is a criminal offence and the QBD is
      essentially a criminal appeal court.
