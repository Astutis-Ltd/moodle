    <p>
      In health and safety cases, criminal proceedings are commenced by the
      laying of an information in the magistrates’ court. The information is
      normally accompanied by a summons, which is intended to secure the
      accused’s attendance at court, in order to answer the allegation(s) made
      against him / her contained in the information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of the information is not only to initiate proceedings. It is
      also used with the summons based upon it, to inform the accused, in clear
      and unambiguous language, of the alleged offence(s) so that an accused can
      consider how she intends to plead and, if appropriate, commence
      preparation of their defence or mitigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary-only cases, an Information must normally be laid (i.e.
      delivered to the court) within 6 months of the offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no time limit for commencing proceedings for an indictable
      offence (including an either way offence). However, in all cases, this
      should be done as soon as possible, as the courts have discretion to
      dismiss a summons on the grounds of abuse of process where there has been
      unjustified delay.

    <p>
