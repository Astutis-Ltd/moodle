    <p>
      The prosecution normally serves the summons on the defendant, which
      requires court attendance on the given date and time. A copy of the
      original summons and certificate of service must be returned to the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summons should be served as soon as possible, and a reasonable time
      before the first hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magistrates have judicial discretion to decline to proceed when service of
      a summons is delayed for so long as to be unconscionable, or where the
      delay has resulted in substantial prejudice to the accused.
    </p>
    <p>
      A summons may be served on an individual or a corporation, as follows:
