    <p>
      The Queen’s Bench Division (QBD) deals with civil cases involving things
      like contracts and negligence but can also hear appeals from lower courts.
      When sitting in that capacity, the court is called a
      <span class="ast-italic">‘Divisional Court of the High Court’</span>. The
      Divisional Courts hear appeals from courts and tribunals below them in the
      hierarchy.
    </p>
    <p>The QBD hears:</p>

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          appeals by way of ‘case stated’ from the decisions of the magistrates’
          courts. The High Court has wide-ranging powers and may reverse the
          decision appealed against, affirm it or amend it. The High Court can
          also send the case back to the Magistrates’ Court with its opinion on
          the point of law concerned which the Magistrates or District Judge
          would then have to apply to the case in question
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          appeals from decisions of employment tribunals relating to prohibition
          and improvement notices.

      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      <span class="ast-italic">Note:</span> Appeals against enforcement notices
      go to the Queen’s Bench Division rather than the Employment Appeal
      Tribunal (EAT) because failure to comply with an enforcement notice is a
      criminal offence and the QBD is essentially a criminal appeal court.
