    <p>
      Health and safety regulations usually come about as a result of
      consultation with the HSE, other government departments and other
      interested bodies. They can also come about as a result of proposals made
      by the HSE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically the HSE starts proposals by circulating a Consultative Document
      to employers’ associations, trade unions and industry associations. The
      proposals may then be modified in the light of comments received. Draft
      regulations are then publicised, amended if necessary, and are 'made' when
      signed by a minister or person with authority under the Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      The regulations, in their final form, are then presented to the Secretary
      of State to be laid before Parliament. This means a copy of the
      regulations with the Votes and Proceedings are physically placed in the
      Journal Office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regulations are then considered by the Joint Committee on Statutory
      Instruments, which has members from both houses. The Joint Committee isn't
      concerned with the policy or merits of the regulations, only the technical
      competence of the minister to make them. They'll establish whether or not
      the regulations are within the powers conferred by the parent Act, and
      whether they contain any unusual or unexpected use of that power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health and safety regulations become law when they're 'made'. They can
      then be vetoed by a negative vote within 40 days of being laid before
      Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regulations have the full force of law until they're revoked or amended in
      some way. It's possible for them to supersede specific provisions of the
      parent Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prime responsibility for health and safety matters now rests with the
      Department for Work and Pensions, although it wouldn't be unusual for
      certain health and safety regulations to emanate from another government
      department. The HSE is one of the DWP’s Non-Departmental Public Bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regulations come into force on 6th April and 1st October each year to
      increase employer awareness of and compliance with new legislation.
