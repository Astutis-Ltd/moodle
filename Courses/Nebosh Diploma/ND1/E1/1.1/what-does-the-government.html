    <p>
      The UK Government legislates with a presumption that regulation shouldn't
      impose costs and obligations on business, social enterprises, individuals
      and community groups unless a robust and compelling case can be made. They
      use a cost benefit analysis to do this.
    </p>
    <p>The Government will only regulate to achieve its policy objectives:</p>

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Having demonstrated that satisfactory outcomes can't be achieved by
          alternative, self-regulatory, or non-regulatory approaches
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Where analysis of the costs and benefits demonstrate that the
          regulatory approach is superior by a clear margin to alternative,
          self-regulatory or non-regulatory approaches
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Where the regulation and enforcement framework can be implemented in a
          fashion which is demonstrably proportionate, accountable, consistent,
          transparent and targeted.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Since January 2013 the Government has adopted a one-in, two-out approach,
      which means any new regulatory measure that is expected to result in a
      direct net cost to business and civil society organisations must be offset
      by compensatory deregulatory measures providing savings to business of at
      least double that amount.
