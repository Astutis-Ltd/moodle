    <p>
      Section 16 of the Health and Safety at Work Act permits the HSE to approve
      and issue codes of practice to provide practical guidance for Sections 2
      to 7 and regulations made under Section 15 (unless excluded by the
      Railways Act 1993 or relating to transport systems under the Railways Act
      2005).
    </p>
    <p>
      The HSE may also approve codes drawn up by other bodies such as the
      British Standards Institution (BSI).
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to approving a code the HSE must consult with government departments
      and other appropriate bodies, then obtain the consent of the Secretary of
      State.
    </p>
    <p>
      When approved the HSE issue a notice identifying the code, the provisions
      for which it is approved, and the date on which its approval takes effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approved codes of practice offer practical examples of good practice and
      how to comply with the law. If, for example, regulations use words like
      ‘suitable and sufficient’ or ‘reasonably practicable’, an approved code of
      practice can illustrate what this requires in particular circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approved codes of practice have a special legal status which can be
      expressed positively or negatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the approved code of practice for the Management of Health
      and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 states:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        'If you follow the advice you will be doing enough to comply with the
        law...'
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      Whereas the approved code of practice for the Workplace (Health, Safety
      and Welfare) Regulations 1992 states:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        'If you are prosecuted for breach of health and safety law, and it is
        proved that you have not followed the relevant provisions of the code, a
        court will find you at fault, unless you can show that you have complied
        with the law in some other way.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      However, a failure on the part of any person to observe the provisions
      contained in an approved code of practice does not, of itself, render that
      person liable to any criminal or civil proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In criminal proceedings approved codes of practice can be used as
      evidence, and a failure to observe them constitutes proof of the breach of
      duty, unless the accused satisfies the court that they complied with the
      requirement of the law in some other manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In civil proceedings it is likely that a failure to observe an approved
      code of practice could constitute evidence of negligence, which would have
      to be rebutted by evidence to the contrary.
