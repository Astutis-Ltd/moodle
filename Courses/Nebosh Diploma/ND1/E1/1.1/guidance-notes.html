      Guidance notes may be specific to the health and safety problems of an
      industry or of a particular process used in a number of industries.
    </p>
    <p>The main purposes of guidance notes are to:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Help people understand what the law says including, for example, how
          requirements based on EC Directives fit with those under the Health
          and Safety at Work Act
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">Help people comply with the law</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">Give technical advice</li>

    <p>
      The HSE may issue a guidance note together with an approved code of
      practice, or independently. Guidance notes contain practical advice and
      sound suggestions, and are frequently more informative than the related
      approved code of practice. The HSE aims to keep guidance up to date
      because as technologies advance, workplace risks and appropriate control
      measures change too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following guidance is not compulsory and employers are free to take other
      action, but if they do follow guidance they will normally be doing enough
      to comply with the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although guidance notes have no legal standing they can be used as
      evidence of the state of knowledge at the time of issue.

            In <span class="ast-bold">Glyn Owen v Sutcliffe</span>, an
            environmental health officer (EHO) issued an improvement notice
            requiring the shoe repairer to install ventilation in his shop,
            following complaints about the smell of solvent fumes.
          </p>
          <p>
            On appeal at the Employment Tribunal, the EHO referred to a relevant
            guidance notice and advice from the British Adhesive Manufacturers
            Association which warned of the dangers of inhaling solvent vapour,
            and suggested suitable ventilation and vapour extraction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Employment Tribunal considered the shoe repairer in breach of
            his general duties under HASAWA and affirmed the improvement notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            In
            <span class="ast-bold"
              >Burgess v Thorn Consumer Electronics (Newhaven) Ltd 1983</span
            >, it was held that if employers do not warn employees of the
            dangers referred to in guidance notes they may be liable to
            employees for negligence, as the guidance notes indirectly give rise
            to a duty of care.
