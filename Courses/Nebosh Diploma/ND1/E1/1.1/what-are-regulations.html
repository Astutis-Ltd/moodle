    <p>
      Regulations are a type of statutory instrument. They're often used to make
      changes to a law without needing to push through a completely new Act of
      Parliament - it's simpler and speedier to introduce a regulation instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regulations may be used to make technical changes to a law or provide more
      practical detail. For example, the Management of Health and Safety at Work
      Regulations 1999 were introduced to provide more detail about what
      employers are required to do to manage health and safety under the Health
      and Safety at Work Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Act that gives a minister the power to make regulations is called an
      'enabling act'. The Health and Safety at Work Act is an example of this.
