    <p>Section 40 of the Health and Safety at Work Act states that:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        In any proceedings for an offence under any of the relevant statutory
        provisions consisting of a failure to comply with a duty or requirement
        to do something so far as is practicable or so far as is reasonably
        practicable, or to use the best practicable means to do something, it
        shall be for the accused to prove (as the case may be) that it was not
        practicable or not reasonably practicable to do more than was in fact
        done to satisfy the duty or requirement, or that there was no better
        practicable means than was in fact used to satisfy the duty or
        requirement.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      In general it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable
      doubt. However, Section 40 provides that in the case of a qualified duty
      it is for the accused to prove that it was not practicable / reasonably
      practicable to do more than was done, or that there was no better
      practicable means available to satisfy the duty or requirement. This
      offers defendants a potential defence if they can show, on the balance of
      probabilities, that in the circumstances they had done everything
      practicable or reasonably practicable, or used the best practicable means
      to prevent a breach of the law.

      The reversed burden of proof does not violate a person’s rights under

            The Court of Appeal has held that it was necessary to balance the
            fundamental rights of the individual with the general interests of
            the community in ensuring health and safety at work, and that the
            reversal of the burden of proof was
