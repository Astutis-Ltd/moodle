    <p>
      A simple caution is an appropriate course of action where there is
      evidence of a criminal offence but the public interest does not require a
      prosecution. The HSE tends to use the term
      <span class="ast-italic">‘formal caution’</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple caution is defined in the enforcement policy statement (EPS) as:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        A statement by an inspector that is accepted in writing by the duty
        holder, that the duty holder has committed an offence for which there is
        a realistic prospect of conviction. A simple caution may only be used
        where a prosecution could be properly brought.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      A repetition of a breach that was the subject of a simple caution will
      normally be treated in the same way as a failure to comply with an
      Enforcement Notice, i.e. with criminal proceedings.
    </p>

    <!--H2 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h2">
      <h5>Crown censure</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The Crown is not exempt from the requirements of the Health and Safety at
      Work Act and relevant statutory provisions, but the Crown cannot be
      prosecuted for breaches of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are administrative arrangements in place by which Crown bodies may
      be censured in respect of offences which would have led to a prosecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Crown censure is the way in which the HSE formally records the decision
      that, but for Crown immunity, the evidence of a Crown body’s failure to
      comply with health and safety law would have been sufficient to provide a
      realistic prospect of securing a conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the HSE intends to administer a Crown censure the HSE notifies the
      Crown body in advance, setting out the evidence against it. The Crown body
      is then given the opportunity to provide a written response prior to a
      formal hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting will be chaired by a senior HSE inspector and minutes taken by
      the HSE. Relevant trade union or other safety representatives will be
      invited to observe the hearing (unless national security or
      confidentiality reasons make this inappropriate). No witnesses are called.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Crown body agrees with the HSE’s view on the sufficiency of
      evidence, the HSE will notify the headquarters of that department or body,
      which in turn will notify the Minister responsible. The HSE will be
      consulted on the submission to the Minister and the censure becomes a
      matter of public record.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Crown body does not accept that there is sufficient evidence, the
      body will be invited to make further representations to the head of the
      appropriate HSE division, who will review the case.
