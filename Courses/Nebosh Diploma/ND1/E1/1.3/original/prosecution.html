    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      In England and Wales the decision to proceed with a court case rests with
      the enforcing authorities who must use discretion in deciding whether to
      bring a prosecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decision of whether to prosecute should take account of the evidential
      stage and the relevant public interest factors set down by the Director of
      Public Prosecutions in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. No prosecution may
      go ahead unless the prosecutor finds there is sufficient evidence to
      provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and decides that prosecution
      would be in the public interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Code for Crown Prosecutors requires the decision to prosecute to be
      kept under continuous review, so that any new facts or circumstances, in
      support of or undermining the prosecutions’ case, are taken into account
      in the decision to continue or terminate the proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the circumstances warrant it and the evidence to support a case is
      available, enforcing authorities may prosecute without prior warning or
      recourse to alternative sanctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subject to the above, enforcing authorities should normally prosecute in
      the public interest where one or more of the following circumstances
      apply:

        guidelines regard death from a criminal act as an aggravating feature of
        the offence. If there is sufficient evidence for conviction, such cases
        should normally be brought before the court. However, there will be
        occasions where the public interest does not require a prosecution)

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Prosecution of individuals</strong></p>
    <p>
      Enforcing authorities are expected to identify and prosecute individuals
      wherever warranted. The management chain and the role played by individual
      directors and managers should be carefully considered and action taken
      where the investigation reveals that the offence was committed with their
      consent, connivance or neglect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where a director is found guilty of a health and safety offence the
      enforcing authorities should consider seeking disqualification of
      directors under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.
