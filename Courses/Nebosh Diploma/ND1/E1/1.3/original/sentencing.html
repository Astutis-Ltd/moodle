    <br />
    <p>
      Since the introduction of the Health and Safety at Work Act the level of
      fines imposed for health and safety offences have regularly been
      criticised for being too low.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Court of Appeal attempted to rectify this in the case of R v Howe
      &amp; Sons (Engineers) Ltd 1999 stating that fines needed to be large
      enough to bring the message home to shareholders and senior managers that
      the courts take the achievement of a safe working environment very
      seriously.
    </p>
    <p>The court suggested the adoption of a three-stage approach:</p>
    <br />
    <div class="h5p-placeholder" contenteditable="false">

    </div>
    <br /><br />
    <p>
      In <strong>R v Friskies Petcare (UK) Ltd 2000</strong> the Court of Appeal
      gave further guidance on the approach to sentencing policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      As most judges will have little experience in identifying the aggravating
      and mitigating features in a health and safety prosecution the concept of
      the <em>‘Friskies schedule’</em> was developed to help. The approach is:

        if the prosecution and the defence agree the aggravating and mitigating
        features, they should commit this to writing and put the agreement into
        court. Where there is no agreement the judge will hear argument on the
        disputed points, form a view and advise the parties of his view, which
        would be relevant in any appeal against the sentence handed down.

    <p>
      It was further suggested that large fines over £500 000, should be
      reserved for cases where a major public disaster occurs, or where large
      numbers of the public have been placed at risk of serious injury, and / or
      where safety has been deliberately sacrificed for profit.
