          requirement to do something so far as is practicable or so far as is
          reasonably practicable, or to use the best practicable means to do
          something, it shall be for the accused to prove (as the case may be)
          that it was not practicable or not reasonably practicable to do more
          than was in fact done to satisfy the duty or requirement, or that
          there was no better practicable means than was in fact used to satisfy

    <p>
      In general it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable
      doubt. However, Section 40 provides that in the case of a qualified duty
      it is for the accused to prove that it was not practicable / reasonably
      practicable to do more than was done, or that there was no better
      practicable means available to satisfy the duty or requirement. This
      offers defendants a potential defence if they can show, on the balance of
      probabilities, that in the circumstances they had done everything
      practicable or reasonably practicable, or used the best practicable means
      to prevent a breach of the law.

          <strong>R v Carr-Briant (1943)</strong> established the principle that

          <p><strong>Davies v Health and Safety Executive, 2002</strong></p>
          <p>
            The Court of Appeal has held that it was necessary to balance the
            fundamental rights of the individual with the general interests of
            the community in ensuring health and safety at work, and that the
            reversal of the burden of proof was
            <em>justified, necessary and proportionate</em> in health and safety
            cases and therefore compatible with the European Convention on Human
            Rights/Human Rights Act.
