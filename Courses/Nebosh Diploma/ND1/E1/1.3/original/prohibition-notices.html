      Section 22 and Section 23 of the Health and Safety at Work Act provide
      that Prohibition Notices (PN) may be served in relation to activities
      which are being, or are likely to be, carried on, and to which any of the
      relevant statutory provisions apply (or will apply).
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 22 allows an inspector to serve a prohibition notice on a person
      if of the opinion that an activity carried on (or likely to be carried on)
      by or under the control of that person involves (or will involve) a risk
      of serious personal injury.

          In <strong>Railtrack plc v Smallwood (2001)</strong> the court held
          that the inspector was entitled to serve a prohibition notice on the
          grounds that activities <em>‘being carried on’</em> involved a risk of
          serious personal injury, even though following a major rail accident
          (Ladbroke Grove), train services along the affected route were
          suspended and resumption of the service was unlikely.

    <p>
      A lack of commonly expected precautions may justify an opinion that there
      is a risk of serious personal injury where other factors, which could have
      reduced the level of risk, are also absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where an inspector is of the opinion that the activity involves a
      contravention of any of the relevant statutory provisions, the PN should
      specify the provision(s) being contravened. However if the inspector
      reasonably believes that there is a risk of serious personal injury, a
      contravention of a statutory provision is not necessary for a PN to be
      valid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prohibition of an activity may either take effect immediately or be
      deferred until the end of a specified period.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deferred prohibition notice would be appropriate where stopping the
      activity immediately would introduce additional risks. This would be the
      case, for example, where it would be dangerous to interrupt a particular
      process in mid-cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prohibition notice may be served on any person in control of a process
      or a piece of plant subject to the relevant statutory provisions,
      including an employee.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prohibition notice, whether immediate or deferred, is not automatically
      suspended by an appeal. The appellant may, however, apply to the
      employment tribunal for a direction suspending operation of the notice
      until the appeal is heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crown notices are the non-statutory equivalent of improvement notices and
      prohibition notices. Crown notices are not legally binding and the Crown
      cannot be prosecuted for a breach of these notices.

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Failure to comply</strong></p>
    <p>
      A failure to comply with the requirements of a prohibition notice or an
      improvement notice is a criminal offence under Section 33(1)(g) of HASAWA.
      The offence is an absolute one, and it is no defence to argue that the
      accused had done that which was reasonably practicable in the
      circumstances.
