    <p>
      Section 28 of HASAWA contains restrictions on disclosure of information by
      an inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspectors must disclose certain information when it is necessary to do so
      for the purpose of assisting in keeping persons employed at any premises
      adequately informed about matters affecting their health, safety and
      welfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information may be disclosed directly to employees or via their safety
      representatives or representatives of employee safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information to be disclosed is factual information (for example:
      information derived from the analysis of samples) obtained by them and
      which relates to premises where the employees work. In such a situation
      inspectors must not only tell the employees the results, but also about
      any steps they will be taking to ensure the employer reduces the hazard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information must also relate to any action they have taken, or propose
      to take, in connection with the workplace, such as giving advice to the
      employer, issuing an improvement or prohibition notice, or taking legal
      proceedings. Any information given to employees must also be given to the
      employer. Such information will not include any medical information
      relating to particular individuals, except with their consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspectors would not normally disclose any information given to them
      voluntarily, unless such information leads to action or investigation at
      the workplace and subsequent information emerges that needs disclosing to
      employees in the interests of health, safety or welfare. Apart from the
      obligation to disclose information to employees, inspectors are generally
      restricted from disclosing information obtained under their powers, except
      in the following circumstances:

    <p>
      A further exception to the restrictions on the disclosure of information
      arises where a person may be party to civil proceedings arising out of an
      accident, or other incident (this may be the claimant or the defendant).
    </p>

    <p>
      In such circumstances, an inspector may give to the person concerned a
      written statement of relevant factual information obtained by them in the
      exercise of their powers. The statement must be confined to facts observed
      by the inspector and cannot include personal views, nor references to any
      information obtained indirectly, for example, by hearsay.
