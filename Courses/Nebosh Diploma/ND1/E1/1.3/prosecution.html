    <p>
      In England and Wales the decision to proceed with a court case rests with
      the enforcing authorities who must use discretion in deciding whether to
      bring a prosecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decision of whether to prosecute should take account of the evidential
      stage and the relevant public interest factors set down by the Director of
      Public Prosecutions in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. No prosecution may
      go ahead unless the prosecutor finds there is sufficient evidence to
      provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and decides that prosecution
      would be in the public interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Code for Crown Prosecutors requires the decision to prosecute to be
      kept under continuous review, so that any new facts or circumstances, in
      support of or undermining the prosecutions’ case, are taken into account
      in the decision to continue or terminate the proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the circumstances warrant it and the evidence to support a case is
      available, enforcing authorities may prosecute without prior warning or
      recourse to alternative sanctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subject to the above, enforcing authorities should normally prosecute in
      the public interest where one or more of the following circumstances
      apply:
    </p>

    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">

          death was a result of a breach of the legislation. (Sentencing
          guidelines regard death from a criminal act as an aggravating feature
          of the offence. If there is sufficient evidence for conviction, such
          cases should normally be brought before the court. However, there will
          be occasions where the public interest does not require a prosecution)

        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          there has been a failure to comply with an improvement or prohibition

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

    <p>
      Where inspectors are assaulted, enforcing authorities will seek police
      assistance, with a view to seeking the prosecution of offenders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enforcing authorities should also consider prosecution, where following
      regulatory contact, one or more of the following circumstances apply:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->

          the law and conviction may deter others from similar failures

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          a breach which gives rise to significant risk has continued, despite

      Although health and safety legislation is identical across Great Britain,
      Scotland differs from England and Wales in two key ways:

        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the enforcing authority (HSE or LA) submits its report to the Crown
          Office Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) who make the decision on
          whether it is in the public interest to prosecute and thereafter
          undertake the prosecution.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Procurators fiscal are civil servants qualified as solicitors,
      solicitor-advocates, or advocates and are independent prosecutors,
      constitutionally responsible to the Lord Advocate.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Enforcing authorities are expected to identify and prosecute individuals
      wherever warranted. The management chain and the role played by individual
      directors and managers should be carefully considered and action taken
      where the investigation reveals that the offence was committed with their
      consent, connivance or neglect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where a director is found guilty of a health and safety offence the
      enforcing authorities should consider seeking disqualification of
      directors under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.
