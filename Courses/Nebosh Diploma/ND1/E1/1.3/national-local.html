      Following the Lofstedt report recommendation that the HSE be given a
      stronger role in directing local authority (LA) health and safety
      enforcement activity, and the red tape challenge, the HSE has published
      the National Local Authority Enforcement Code.

      The Code adopts the same principles of enforcement as the HSEâ€™s
      enforcement policy and as a consequence local authorities should only
      proactively inspect premises with higher risks or where intelligence
      suggests that risks are not being effectively managed.
