    <p>
      Section 21 of HASAWA states that an improvement notice (IN) is appropriate
      where an inspector is of the opinion that a person is contravening a
      relevant statutory provision, or has contravened a provision in
      circumstances that make it likely that the contravention will continue or
      be repeated.
    </p>
    <p>The improvement notice should:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">state that inspectorâ€™s opinion</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          specify the provision(s) in question
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          give particulars of the reasons why the inspector is of that opinion
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          require the person to remedy the contravention or the matters
          occasioning it
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          specify the period for compliance, which should be not less than 21
          days from the date of service of the notice, being the period in which
          the recipient of the notice may lodge an appeal with the employment
          tribunal.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      There should be a discussion with the duty holder about the notice and how
      to comply with it and efforts should be made to resolve any points of
      difference before a notice is served.
    </p>
    <p>
      Requirements for works to a building's structure cannot be more onerous
      than current building regulations, unless a relevant statutory provision
      specifically imposes more onerous requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      An improvement notice cannot be used to require a duty holder to do
      something which has no attainable end within the compliance period, for
      example: on-going maintenance of a control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The improvement notice cannot require a duty holder to go beyond what is
      legally required of them. Advice on best practice may be included in a
      covering letter, making it clear that it is guidance and does not form
      part of the notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an appeal is brought against service of an improvement notice, the
      operation of the notice is suspended until the appeal is either heard or
      withdrawn.
