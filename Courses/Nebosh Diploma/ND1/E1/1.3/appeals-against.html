    </p>

      The Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure) Regulations
      2004 empower the employment tribunal to do the following upon receipt of

      An employment tribunal typically comprises a legally qualified chairman
      and two other members, one representing employers, the other, employees. A
      hearing can proceed with just the chairman and one member if the parties
      consent. In that situation the chairman will have the casting vote.

      <p>Objective of the hearing</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      An employment tribunal’s powers will be exercised in accordance with the
      ‘overriding objective’ to deal with the cases justly which includes:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">saving expense</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate to its
          complexity, expeditiously and fairly.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The hearing will normally be in public, unless a party applies for it to
      be heard in private on grounds of national security or business
      confidentiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either side may be represented by a solicitor, barrister or other person
      such as a trade union official or an employers’ association
      representative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each side is entitled to make an opening statement, give evidence on oath,
      call witnesses, cross-examine witnesses from the other side, introduce
      documentary or other evidence and make a closing submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tribunal will then make its decision, which may be a unanimous one or
      by a majority. If the tribunal consists only of two members, the chairman
      has a casting vote. The decision may be given orally or in writing after
      consideration and a formal written declaration sent to both sides.

      An appeal may be lodged on the ground that the inspector acted ‘ultra
      vires’, i.e. lacked the legal power to impose an enforcement notice. This
      may be because:

      An appeal from a decision of an employment tribunal which relates to an

      Employment tribunal decisions may be used to ‘persuade’ other Tribunals on
      the correct approach to adopt, but they are not binding. Some decisions
      may be in the Industrial Relations Law Reports(IRLR) or Industrial Cases
      Reports (ICR).
