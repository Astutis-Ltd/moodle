    <p>
      Since the introduction of the Health and Safety at Work Act the level of
      fines imposed for health and safety offences have regularly been
      criticised for being too low.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Court of Appeal attempted to rectify this in the case of R v Howe &
      Sons (Engineers) Ltd 1999 stating that fines needed to be large enough to
      bring the message home to shareholders and senior managers that the courts
      take the achievement of a safe working environment very seriously.
    </p>
    <p>The court suggested the adoption of a three-stage approach:</p>

    <!-- H5P -->
    <div style="margin: 20px 0">
      <div class="h5p-placeholder" contenteditable="false">
        https://mylearning.astutis.com/draftfile.php/524/user/draft/286859129/accordion-5.h5p
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      In <span class="ast-bold">R v Friskies Petcare (UK) Ltd 2000</span> the
      Court of Appeal gave further guidance on the approach to sentencing
      policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      As most judges will have little experience in identifying the aggravating
      and mitigating features in a health and safety prosecution the concept of
      the <span class="ast-italic">‘Friskies schedule’</span> was developed to
      help. The approach is:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the prosecutor should list the aggravating features that he says are
          present
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          this list should be served on the defendant and the court
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          in the event of the defendant pleading guilty the defence should
          submit a similar document, outlining mitigating features they say are
          present
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          if the prosecution and the defence agree the aggravating and
          mitigating features, they should commit this to writing and put the
          agreement into court. Where there is no agreement the judge will hear
          argument on the disputed points, form a view and advise the parties of
          his view, which would be relevant in any appeal against the sentence
          handed down.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      It was further suggested that large fines over £500 000, should be
      reserved for cases where a major public disaster occurs, or where large
      numbers of the public have been placed at risk of serious injury, and / or
      where safety has been deliberately sacrificed for profit.
