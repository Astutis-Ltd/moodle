      <p>Section 25 â€“ Power to deal with cause of imminent danger</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Where, an inspector finds any article or substance which is a cause of
      imminent danger or serious personal injury, he may seize it and cause it
      to be rendered harmless by destruction or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before any article or substance is rendered harmless the inspector shall,
      wherever practicable, take a sample and give a suitably identified portion
      to a responsible person at the premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as possible after seizing and rendering harmless any article or
      substance, the inspector must prepare and sign a written report giving
      particulars of the circumstances in which the article or substance was
      seized and dealt with.
    </p>
    <p>
      A signed copy of the report should be given to a responsible person at the
      premises and (if different) the owner of the article or substance. Where
      the name or address of the owner cannot be established the owners copy may
      be served by giving it to the responsible person at the premises.
