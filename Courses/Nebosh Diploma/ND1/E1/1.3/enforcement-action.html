    <p>
      The HSE enforcement policy states that 'enforcement' has a wide meaning
      and applies to all dealings between enforcing authorities and duty holders
      (employers, the self-employed, employees, manufacturers, suppliers, etc).
    </p>
    <p>The purpose of enforcement is to:</p>

          risks

          promote and achieve sustained compliance with the law

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Inspectors exercise professional judgement based on the circumstance of a
      particular case to determine the appropriate course of enforcement action.
      The Enforcement Management Model (EMM) provides a framework of guidance to
      help ensure consistency of approach and consideration of the business
      context.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EMM provides a framework to help inspectors reach enforcement
      decisions and in particular with the principles of proportionality,
      consistency and transparency. The EMM takes into account the actual risk
      present and the seriousness of any regulatory breach which might be
      apparent.
    </p>
    <p>The EMM is structured a seven step process as follows:</p>
