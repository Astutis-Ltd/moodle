    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">‘summary’</span> offences, which are held in a
          magistrates’ court
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          <span class="ast-bold">either way’</span> offences, which can be heard
          in either the magistrates’ court or on indictment in the Crown Court.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      No health and safety offences are
      <span class="ast-italic">‘indictable only’</span> (only triable in the
      Crown Court) although health and safety offences may be linked to
      indictable only offences, such as manslaughter, and will be heard in the
      Crown Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">‘Summary’</span> offences are heard in the
      magistrates’ court. Proceedings must normally commence within 6 months of
      the date of the offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In cases involving <span class="ast-bold">‘either way’</span> offences, a
      decision must be made as to whether the case should be heard in the
      magistrates’ court or the Crown Court. This is done at the
      <span class="ast-italic">‘mode of trial’</span>
      hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the defendant agrees to have the case dealt with at the magistrates’
      court and pleads guilty, the magistrates may hear a case that they
      consider is suitable for summary trial straight after the
      <span class="ast-italic">‘mode of trial’</span>
      hearing. If the defendant pleads not guilty in a case that the magistrates
      consider is suitable for summary trial, the case will usually be
      adjourned.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Scotland most cases are prosecuted summarily by a procurator fiscal.
      Most cases are heard in the sheriff court by means of a summary complaint
      (where the sheriff hears the case alone). For health and safety offences,
      proceedings are normally raised in the sheriff court by means of a
      petition. In the most serious cases, the Crown may decide to proceed by
      solemn procedure (i.e. trial by jury).

      <p>Representation to the courts</p>

    <p>
      In cases of sufficient seriousness, and when given the opportunity, the
      enforcing authorities should consider indicating to the magistrates that
      the offence is so serious that they may send it to be heard or sentenced
      in the higher court where higher penalties can be imposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In considering what representations to make, enforcing authorities should
      have regard to Court of Appeal guidance which says:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        'In our judgment magistrates should always think carefully before
        accepting jurisdiction in health and safety at work cases, where it is
        arguable that the fine may exceed the limit of their jurisdiction or
        where death or serious injury has resulted from the offence.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Death at work</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Where there has been a breach of the law leading to a work-related death,
      enforcing authorities need to consider whether the circumstances of the
      case might justify a charge of manslaughter or corporate manslaughter
      (culpable homicide or corporate homicide in Scotland).
    </p>
    <p>
      The HSE, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), the British
      Transport Police, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the Local
      Government Association (LGA) and the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) have
      jointly agreed and published Work-related deaths: A protocol for liaison.
    </p>
    <p>
      In England and Wales the police are responsible for deciding whether to
      pursue a manslaughter or corporate manslaughter investigation and whether
      to refer a case to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider possible
      manslaughter charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enforcing authorities are responsible for investigating possible
      health and safety offences. If in the course of their health and safety
      investigation, the enforcing authorities find evidence suggesting
      manslaughter or corporate manslaughter, they should pass it on to the
      police.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the police or CPS decide not to pursue a manslaughter or corporate
      manslaughter case, the enforcing authorities will normally bring a health
      and safety prosecution in accordance with the enforcement policy.
