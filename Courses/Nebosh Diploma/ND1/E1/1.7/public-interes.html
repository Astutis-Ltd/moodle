    <p>
      The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (PIDA) was introduced in response
      to a spate of scandals and disasters in the late 1980s / early 1990s where
      workers were afraid to raise issues with management (examples: Clapham
      train crash or Piper Alpha) or had raised them and been ignored (example:
      Herald of Free Enterprise).
    </p>
    <p>
      The PIDA encourages people to ‘blow the whistle’ about (report)
      malpractice in the workplace and is designed to ensure that organisations
      respond by acting on the message rather than against the messenger.
    </p>
    <p>The range of malpractices covered includes:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">crimes</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          civil offences (including negligence, breach of contract,
          <span class="ast-italic">etc.</span> )
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">miscarriage of justice</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          danger to health and safety or the environment. It also includes the
          cover-up of any of these.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      The Public Interest Disclosure Act applies whether or not the information
      is confidential and extends to malpractice occurring in the UK and any
      other country or territory. In addition to employees, it covers agency
      staff, contractors, home workers, trainees and every professional in the
      NHS.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be protected, disclosures must be made
      <span class="ast-italic">‘in good faith’,</span> i.e. be an honest attempt
      to address a genuine concern. Disclosures may be classed as internal,
      regulatory or wider.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Internal disclosures</span> made in good faith to a
      manager or the employer will be protected if the whistleblower has a
      reasonable suspicion that the malpractice has occurred, is occurring or is
      likely to occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Regulatory disclosures</span> made in good faith to
      prescribed bodies such as the HSE, where the
      <span class="ast-italic">‘whistleblower’</span> has a reasonable belief
      that the information and their allegation(s) are substantially true, are
      protected if the whistleblower meets the test for internal disclosure and
      believes the information to be true and of interest to the regulator.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Wider disclosures</span> to the media, MPs, the
      police and non-prescribed regulators are protected if, in addition to the
      tests for regulatory disclosures, they are reasonable in all the
      circumstances, are not made for personal gain and fulfil at least one of
      the following preconditions:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          reasonably believed they would be victimised if they raised the matter
          internally or with a designated
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">regulator</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          reasonably believed a cover-up was likely and there was no regulator
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          had already raised the matter internally or with a prescribed
          regulator
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the concern was of an exceptionally serious nature.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      An employee who makes a wide, public disclosure is more likely to be
      protected if there was no internal procedure set up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the whistleblower is victimised in breach of the Act they can bring
      a claim to an employment tribunal for compensation. Awards are uncapped
      and based on the losses suffered. Additionally, where an employee is
      sacked, they may apply for an interim order to keep their job.
