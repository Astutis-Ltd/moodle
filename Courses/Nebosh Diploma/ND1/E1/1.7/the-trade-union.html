    <p>
      Union representatives have had a statutory right to reasonable paid time
      off from employment to carry out trade union duties and to undertake trade
      union training since the Employment Protection Act 1975. Union
      representatives and members were also given a statutory right to
      reasonable unpaid time off when taking part in trade union activities. All
      the time off provisions were brought together in the Trade Union and
      Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 – Sections 168 to 173.

      <p>Section 168 – Time off for carrying out trade union duties</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The employer has an absolute duty to permit an employee who is an official
      of an independent trade union recognised by the employer, to take time off
      during his working hours for the purpose of carrying out any official
      duties, or for the purpose of undergoing training in aspects of industrial
      relations.

      <p>Section 169 – Payment for time off</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Where an employee is permitted to take time off under Section 168 the
      employer has to pay him for the time taken off.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Section 170 – Time off for trade union activities</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The employer shall also permit an employee of his who is a member of an
      independent trade union recognised by the employer to take time off during
      his working hours for the purpose of taking part in union activities or
      activities in which the employee is acting as a representative of the
      union.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amount of time off which an employee is permitted to take off under
      Sections 168 and 170 should be reasonable in all the circumstances having
      regard to any relevant provisions of a Code of Practice issued by Acas.
    </p>
    <p>
      An employee may present a complaint to an employment tribunal that his
      employer has failed to permit him to take time off under Sections 168 or
      170, or failed to pay him under section 169.
