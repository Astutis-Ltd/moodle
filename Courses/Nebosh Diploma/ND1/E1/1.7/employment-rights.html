      The Employment Rights Act 1996 (ERA96) updated much earlier labour law,
      including the Contracts of Employment Act 1963, the Redundancy Payments
      Act 1965, the Employment Protection Act 1975 and the Wages Act 1986. It
      applies across the whole of the United Kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ERA96 set out the rights of employees in situations such as dismissal,
      unfair dismissal, parental leave, and redundancy. In 1997, the act was
      amended strengthening the right of an employee to request flexible working

      Employeeâ€™s may have been given these rights previously either explicitly
      or impliedly within contracts of employment. The Act now enshrines those
      rights in statutory law.

    <p>The key employee rights under the ERA96 include:</p>
