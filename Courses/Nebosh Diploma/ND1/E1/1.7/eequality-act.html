    <p>
      The Equality Act 2010 harmonised and replaced previous legislation (such
      as the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Disability Discrimination Act
      1995). The Act covers the same groups that were protected by previous
      equality legislation, i.e. age, disability, gender reassignment, race,
      religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, marriage and civil
      partnership, and pregnancy and maternity, which are now called
      <span class="ast-bold">‘protected characteristics’.</span>

          a business or organisation, but if there is a discriminatory effect
          the sole aim of reducing costs is likely to be unlawful. Indirect
          discrimination can be applied to age, race, religion or belief, sex,

    <p>
      The Equality Act has introduced a new definition of disability and made it
      easier for a person to show that they are disabled and protected from
      disability discrimination.
    </p>
    <p>
      A person is disabled if they have a physical or mental impairment which
      has a substantial and long term adverse effect on their ability to carry
      out normal day-to-day activities. The employer has a duty to make
      reasonable adjustments to help employees overcome disadvantage resulting
      from an impairment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Equality Act includes a new protection from discrimination arising
      from disability stating that it is discrimination to treat a disabled
      person unfavourably because of something connected with their disability
      (for example, a tendency to make spelling mistakes arising from dyslexia).
      This type of discrimination is unlawful unless the employer can show that
      it is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Equality Act also includes a new provision which makes it unlawful,
      except in certain circumstances, for employers to ask about a candidate’s
      health before offering them work.

      <p>Sex discrimination</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      A person directly discriminates against a woman if, on the ground of her
      sex, they treat her less favourably than they would treat a man. Typically
      this occurs on the grounds of sex or marital status.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indirect discrimination is also an offence. This occurs where an
      apparently neutral requirement or condition is applicable, but members of
      a certain sex are less able to meet the requirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The law also requires that men receive equal treatment, but the vast
      majority of claims are from women.

            >
            Mrs. Page was a 23 year old HGV driver. Following a recommendation
            from ICI that women of child-bearing age should not be employed in
            driving lorries loaded with the chemical dimethyl- formamide (DMF),
            Mrs. Page was taken off that kind of work. She brought a claim of
            unlawful sex discrimination.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was held that if there was a real danger to women from certain
            processes or chemicals then the duty to ensure their safety took
            precedence over the duty not to discriminate. As the evidence from
            the manufacturers was that the chemical was dangerous to women of
            Mrs. Page’s age, the step of taking her off that work was a
            reasonable one in compliance with Section 2 of the Health and Safety
            at Work etc. Act 1974. There was therefore no unlawful
            discrimination.

      Race discrimination occurs when a person is treated less favourably

            <span class="ast-bold">Essa v Laing Ltd (2004)</span> Essa was a
            Welshman of black Somali origin who worked as a labourer on the
            construction of the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. He was subjected
            to racial abuse and insults.
          </p>
          <p>
            His complaints to his employers were not taken seriously. Eventually
            Essa walked off the job and complained of constructive dismissal and
            race discrimination. His complaints were upheld and he was awarded
            £5,000 compensation for injury to feelings and £500 for financial
            loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            Essa was treated for depression and allegedly underwent a major
            personality change, becoming prejudiced against white people and
            violent and aggressive. As a consequence of his psychological
            treatment, Essa appealed to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and then
            the Court of Appeal in pursuit of a larger compensation award.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately the appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal decided
            that the appropriate test to be applied in assessing compensation
            for a victim of unlawful race discrimination was the establishment
            of a causal link between the act of discrimination and the alleged
            injury.

      It is unlawful to discriminate against any disabled person in connection
      with employment, the provision of goods, facilities and services or the
      disposal or management of premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Equality Act is supplemented by various regulations and a Code of
      Practice and Guidance Notes. In particular, the guidance must be taken
      into account when a tribunal is reaching a decision on whether a person is
      suffering from a disability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether a person is disabled or not, according to the legal definition,
      has been subject to much interpretation through guidance and by the courts
      and employment tribunals. A person with a disability can be described as
      someone with:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        …a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial and long-term
        adverse effect on his ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.

      <p>Physical or mental impairment</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Physical impairments must be real and not psychosomatic but if there are
      physical symptoms, the existence or non-existence of a physical cause is
      irrelevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mental impairment does not have to be a clinically well-recognised
      illness but has to be a substantial impairment having a long-term adverse
      effect. Vague expressions such as depression or anxiety are not helpful
      but may be indicative of, a mental impairment if there is evidence of the
      long-term adverse effect of the illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addictions to alcohol, nicotine or other substances do not in themselves
      constitute an impairment but if there is a physical or mental impairment,
      the fact that it was caused by such an addiction is not relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      A medical advisor can express an opinion about diagnosis, prognosis etc.
      but it is for the employment tribunal to determine whether or not a person
      is disabled.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Substantial and long-term adverse effect</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Any impairment must have lasted, or be expected to last, for a period of
      months.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the impairment ceases to have a substantial effect on a person’s
      ability to carry out day-to-day activities but is likely to recur it will
      still be treated as having that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Persons who suffer from cancer, HIV and multiple sclerosis will be deemed
      to be disabled from the moment of diagnosis, rather than from the time the
      illness takes a long-term effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone certified or registered blind or partially sighted is deemed to be
      disabled for the purpose of the Equality Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether an impairment has a substantial effect on a person’s ability to
      carry out normal day-to-day activities should not be judged purely on
      their ability to carry our their job. If the effects fluctuate and are
      exacerbated by work, then the performance of normal day-to-day activities
      both while at work and while not at work should be taken into account.
    </p>
    <p>
      To assess whether an impairment has a substantial adverse effect or not,
      the tribunal should concentrate on what a claimant cannot do or can only
      do with difficulty, and not on what he can do. It is the effect of the
      impairment that must be substantial, not the severity of the impairment.

      Normal day-to-day activities are those which affect a person with regard
