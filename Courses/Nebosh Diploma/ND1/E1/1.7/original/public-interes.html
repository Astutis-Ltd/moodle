    <p>
      The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (PIDA) was introduced in response
      to a spate of scandals and disasters in the late 1980s / early 1990s where
      workers were afraid to raise issues with management (examples: Clapham
      train crash or Piper Alpha) or had raised them and been ignored (example:
      Herald of Free Enterprise).
    </p>
    <p>
      The PIDA encourages people to ‘blow the whistle’ about (report)
      malpractice in the workplace and is designed to ensure that organisations
      respond by acting on the message rather than against the messenger.
    </p>
    <p>The range of malpractices covered includes:</p>

    <p>
      The Public Interest Disclosure Act applies whether or not the information
      is confidential and extends to malpractice occurring in the UK and any
      other country or territory. In addition to employees, it covers agency
      staff, contractors, home workers, trainees and every professional in the
      NHS.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be protected, disclosures must be made<em> ‘in good faith’, i.e</em>.
      be an honest attempt to address a genuine concern. Disclosures may be
      classed as internal, regulatory or wider.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Internal disclosures </strong>made in good faith to a manager or
      the employer will be protected if the whistleblower has a reasonable
      suspicion that the malpractice has occurred, is occurring or is likely to
      occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span><strong>Regulatory disclosures</strong></span> made in good faith to
      prescribed bodies such as the HSE, where the <em>‘whistleblower’</em> has
      a reasonable belief that the information and their allegation(s) are
      substantially true, are protected if the whistleblower meets the test for
      internal disclosure and believes the information to be true and of
      interest to the regulator.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Wider disclosures</strong> to the media, MPs, the police and
      non-prescribed regulators are protected if, in addition to the tests for
      regulatory disclosures, they are reasonable in all the circumstances, are
      not made for personal gain and fulfil at least one of the following
      preconditions:

    <p>
      An employee who makes a wide, public disclosure is more likely to be
      protected if there was no internal procedure set up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the whistleblower is victimised in breach of the Act they can bring
      a claim to an employment tribunal for compensation. Awards are uncapped
      and based on the losses suffered. Additionally, where an employee is
      sacked, they may apply for an interim order to keep their job.
