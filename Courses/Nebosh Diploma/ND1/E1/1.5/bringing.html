    <p>
      To bring a civil claim it is necessary for the claimant to prove that they
      have suffered a loss or injury as a result of another person’s negligence
      or breach of statutory duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most civil disputes do not end up in court, and those that do often don’t
      go to a full trial. Where a case does go through the courts, the aim is to
      make it as simple as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="ast-bold">Small Claims</span> Court provides a relatively
      quick and cheap way of resolving a legal dispute claims for compensation
      for injuries or illness caused by work are mainly dealt with in the
      <span class="ast-bold">County Court</span> although more substantial or
      complex cases will be heard in the
      <span class="ast-bold">High Court.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      To commence an action, a claimant must file the following documents with
      the court:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">a Claim Form</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">a Statement of Claim</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          a Schedule of Special Damage if applicable
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">the Court fee</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          any additional documents required by the Court rules. e.g in a
          personal injury case it is necessary to file a medical report.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Once the proceedings have been
      <span class="ast-italic">‘issued’,</span> the Court will send a sealed
      copy of the documents to the Defendant to include:
    </p>

    <!--List Numbered Start-->

            a form for acknowledging service of the claim, and for admitting or

    <p>
      If the value of the Claim is between £10 000 and £25 000 the matter will
      usually be allocated to the fast track. This track is appropriate where:
