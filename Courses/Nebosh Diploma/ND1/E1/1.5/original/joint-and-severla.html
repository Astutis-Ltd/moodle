    <p>
      Joint and several liability is a legal term for a responsibility that is
      shared by two or more parties to a lawsuit. A wronged party may sue any or
      all of them, and collect the total damages awarded by a court from any or
      all of them.

    <p>Joint and several liability may arise under:</p>

      Responsibility for the total amount awarded is shared by all. Failure by
      any of the parties to pay would increase the obligation of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a case where multiple defendants are involved in the commission of a
      tort, whether or not joint liability exists is determined by focusing on
      the ‘cause of action’ i.e. the acts that were committed that gave rise to
      liability in the first place.
