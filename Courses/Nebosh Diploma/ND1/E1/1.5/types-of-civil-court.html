      <p>County Court</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The County Court deals with a range of civil cases including businesses
      trying to recover money they are owed, landowners seeking orders that will
      prevent trespass and as is relevant here –
      <span class="ast-bold"
        >individuals seeking compensation for injuries.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Most County Courts centres are assigned at least one circuit judge and one
      district judge. Circuit judges generally hear cases worth over £25 000 or
      involving greater importance or complexity. They also hear many of the
      cases worth over £10 000 but not over £25 000.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast majority of civil cases tried in court do not have a jury and the
      judge hears them on his own, deciding them by finding facts, applying the
      relevant law to them, and then giving a reasoned judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judges also play an active role in managing civil cases once they have
      started, helping to ensure they proceed as quickly and efficiently as
      possible by:

    <p>
      Once the judge has heard the evidence from all parties involved and any
      submissions (representations) they wish to put forward, he delivers his
      judgment. This may be immediately, or if the case is complicated, at a
      later date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, civil cases do not involve the imposition of any punishment.
      However, anyone who does not comply with the court’s judgment can be
      arrested and prosecuted for contempt of court.

    <p>
      The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 (CRA) was introduced to totally
      separate the powers and functions of politicians and judges, and create a
      judicial system which is totally independent in practice as well as in
      theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CRA abolished the appellate functions of the House of Lords and
      replaced it with the Supreme Court, which consists of 12 senior judges
      appointed by Her Majesty. The first members of the Supreme Court were
      those Lords of Appeal in Ordinary who previously sat in the House of
      Lords.
    </p>
    <p>Legal rulings given by the former House of Lords remain effective.</p>

    <p>Industrial tribunals were created in 1964 to provide:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        …an easily accessible, speedy, informal and inexpensive procedure for
        the settlement of disputes between employers and workers.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      Tribunal proceedings are generally less formal than courts, in that any
      person may represent a party before an employment tribunal, and costs are
      not normally awarded to the winner.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were renamed as employment tribunals by the Employment Rights
      (Dispute Resolution) Act 1998.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employment tribunals are arranged on a regional basis and each comprises:

      Decisions of employment tribunals do not constitute legal precedents
      though they are valued for their reasoning and guidance.

    <p>
      <span class="ast-italic">*Note:</span> an appeal against a decision of an
      employment tribunal on a point of law relating to cases concerning health
      and safety enforcement notices will go to the Queen’s Bench Divisional
      Court, but appeals on all other matters will go to the Employment Appeal
      Tribunal.

      <p>Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT)</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The main function of the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) is to hear
      appeals on points of law from the decisions of employment tribunals. The
      EAT comprises a High Court judge and two lay members, one from a panel
      representing employers, and the other representing the workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Procedures are relatively informal. Legal representation is not insisted
      upon, costs are not normally awarded to the winner, and the procedure is
      designed to hear cases in a quick and straightforward manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appeals from the Employment Appeal Tribunal are to the court of appeal.
