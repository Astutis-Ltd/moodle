    <p>
      SARHA makes provision about civil liability for negligence and for certain
      breaches of a statutory duty. When a claim is brought against an
      individual or organisation <span class="ast-italic">e.g.</span> employer)
      the court must determine whether or not the defendant has successfully
      discharged their <span class="ast-italic">‘duty of care’.</span> SARHA
      sets out additional factors that the court must consider in regard of the
      defendants action, i.e. whether it was for the benefit of society, whether
      it was generally responsible, and whether it was heroic.
    </p>

      SARHA was introduced seemingly to tackle two government concerns of the
      day:

      of the main sponsors of SARHA said about it:

      The Act passed remarkably quickly through the parliamentary processes. It
      was proposed in the Queen’s Speech in June 2014 and was brought into force
      in April 2015.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was heavily criticised in the House of Lords as
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >‘a pointless, indeed fatuous, piece of legislation’, ‘half-baked’</span
      >
      and <span class="ast-italic">‘a waste of legislative time’.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally Parliament creates statutes such as SARHA to clarify issues that
      have evolved in the common law. Most commentators consider that SARHA
      merely restates the common law and repeats sections of the Compensation
      Act 2006, although others identify potential opportunities for change. In
      legal terms SARHA is still new legislation and has yet to be tested and
      debated in the courts, so its value is still unclear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 1 of the Compensation Act 2006 provides that, where a court is
      considering a claim in negligence or breach of statutory duty, it may, in
      determining whether the defendant should have taken particular steps to
      meet a standard of care,
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >‘have regard to whether a requirement to take those steps might (a)
        prevent a desirable activity from being undertaken at all, to a
        particular extent or in a particular way, or (b) discourage persons from
        undertaking functions in connection with a desirable activity.’</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The provisions of SARHA Act do not change the overarching framework laid
      down in the Compensation Act 2006, but states that a court which is
      determining what was required to meet the standard of care in a specific
      case must have regard to the matters mentioned in Sections 2 to 4 of the
      Act:
