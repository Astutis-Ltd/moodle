    <p>
      A tortfeasor is a person who has committed a tort. Where a claimant has
      suffered damage at the hands of more than one tortfeasor, liability may be
      shared and action taken against joint tortfeasors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joint tortfeasors are jointly responsible to the same claimant for causing
      him the same damage, and share liability on the same facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such cases each tortfeasor could be sued for the full amount of the
      loss, although the claimant cannot recover damages more than once. Where
      the proportion of fault can be determined, the claim may be enforced
      against either tortfeasor, who can then claim a contribution from the
      other to the extent of the other’s liability under the Civil Liability
      (Contribution) Act 1978.

            >
            a lorry driver, employed by the defendants, negligently reversed a
            company vehicle into a fellow employee (his father). The injured
            employee was successful in his claim and was awarded damages. After
            paying the claim the defendant’s insurance company subsequently
            successfully sued the lorry driver in the name of the company to
            recover what they had paid out.
          </p>
          <p>
            The courts held that an employee can be sued instead of, or in
            addition to, the employer where he has been negligent.

    <p>
      Where the same damage is caused by two or more tortfeasors who are not
      acting jointly (separate and independent tortfeasors) they would be sued
      separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where multiple tortfeasors independently inflict different items of damage
      on the same claimant (independent or ‘several’ tortfeasors) liabilities
      are separate, and each tortfeasor is only responsible for his own breach
      and the resultant harm caused.
