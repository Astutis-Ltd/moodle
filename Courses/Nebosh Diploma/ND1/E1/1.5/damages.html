    <p>
      Damages or compensation for injury or loss are intended to put the
      claimant in the position they would have been in had they not suffered the
      loss. The claimant should not profit as a result of his loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      In determining the monetary value of the compensation claim two elements,
      termed special and general damages, are considered:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Special damages</span> financially compensate the
      claimant for losses suffered due to the defendant’s actions. They are ‘out
      of pocket’ expenses and directly quantifiable financial losses such as:

    <p>
      Special damages cover losses incurred before the date of the trial and are
      calculated by the claimant’s legal team.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Scottish law the term
      <span class="ast-italic">‘patrimonial damages’</span> is used in place of
      ‘special damages’ to cover financial losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">General damages</span> flow naturally from the
      defendant’s wrongful action. There is a clear link between the defendant’s
      behaviour and the plaintiff’s injury. General damages are unliquidated
      which generally means that it is for the court to assign a monetary value
      to the injury suffered (the claimant and defendant may agree a figure
      subject to determination of liability).
    </p>
    <p>General damages can include:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">physical pain and suffering</li>

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">physical impairment</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          loss of amenity or facility as a consequence of the injury
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">mental anguish</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          loss of companionship (paid to family members in wrongful death cases)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">lowered qualify of life.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      In Scottish law the term <span class="ast-italic">‘solatium’</span> is
      used instead of <span class="ast-italic">‘general damages’</span>
      to address damages awarded for pain and suffering etc. they may also be
      referred to as non-patrimonial damages.
