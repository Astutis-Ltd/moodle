      In the early 1990s the civil legal system was considered slow, cumbersome
      and costly. In 1994 Lord Woolf (Master of the Rolls) was instructed by the
      Lord Chancellor to report on options for consolidating the existing civil
      procedures rules and improving access to justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Woolf’s final report Access to Justice (July 1996), identified a
      number of key principles for refining the civil justice system to ensure
      access to justice. The new system was intended to be fairer, speedier and
      cheaper, and:

      The Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) apply to all cases commenced after 26
      April 1999. The Civil procedures rules are updated regularly – the 127th
      Practice Direction Update was published in early 2021 and The Civil
      Procedure (Amendment) Rules 2021 came into force in April 2021. The most
      current information can always be found on the Ministry of Justice
      website.

    <p>
      Judges take a more active role by setting strict timetables, documents
      have to be disclosed at an early stage, Latin terminology has been
      abolished, and early settlements through mediation or arbitration are
      encouraged.

      Civil claims involving health and safety issues are primarily dealt with
      through the Personal Injury Pre-action Protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failure to comply with the protocols could lead to essential evidence
      being excluded, or an award of costs being made against the party in
      default.

      <p>Pre-action protocol for personal injury claims</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      This protocol is primarily designed for personal injury claims which are
      likely to be allocated to the fast track and to the entirety of those
      claims: not only to the personal injury element of a claim which also
      includes, for instance, property damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claims for losses arising from road traffic incidents and cases of
      occupational illness are dealt with under other, specific protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
      The below diagram illustrates the likely progression of a claim under this
      protocol.

    <p>
      This Protocol sets out conduct that the court would normally expect
      prospective parties to follow prior to the commencement of proceedings. It
      establishes the process and timetable for the exchange of information
      relevant to a dispute; sets standards for the content and quality of
      letters of claim; explains how pre-action negotiations should be actioned.
      In particular, the parts of this Protocol that are concerned with
      rehabilitation are likely to be of application in all claims.
    </p>
    <p>The objectives of the Protocol are to:</p>

    <p>
      The claimant / claimants legal representative may wish to notify a
      defendant and / or the insurer as soon as they know a claim is likely to
      be made, particularly where the defendant has no or limited knowledge of
      the incident giving rise to the claim, or where the claimant is incurring
      significant costs from the accident which he hopes to recover from the

      <p>Rehabilitation</p>

    <p>
      All parties should discuss, as early as possible, whether the claimant has
      reasonable needs that could be met by medical treatment or other
      rehabilitative measures and how best those needs might be addressed. The
      International Underwriting Association of London (IUA) Rehabilitation Code
      provides recommended framework.

      A letter of claim should contain a clear summary of the facts on which the
      claim is based, together with an indication of the nature of injuries
      suffered and financial loss incurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter should ask for details of the insurer and that a copy should be
      sent by the proposed defendant to the insurer, where appropriate.
      Sufficient information should be given in order to enable the defendant’s
      insurer / solicitor to commence investigations and at least put a broad
      valuation on the ‘risk’.

      The defendant should reply within 21 calendar days of the date of posting
      of the letter, identifying the insurer (if any) and, if necessary,
      identifying specifically any significant omissions from the letter of
      claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there has been no reply by the defendant or insurer within 21 days, the
      claimant will be entitled to issue proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The defendant(’s insurers) will have a maximum of three months from the
      date of acknowledgment of the claim to investigate and reply, stating
      whether liability is denied and, if so, giving reasons for their denial of
      liability including any alternative version of events relied upon.
