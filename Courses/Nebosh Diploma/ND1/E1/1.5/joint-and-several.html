    <p>
      Joint and several liability is a legal term for a responsibility that is
      shared by two or more parties to a lawsuit. A wronged party may sue any or
      all of them, and collect the total damages awarded by a court from any or
      all of them.
    </p>
    <p>Joint and several liability may arise under:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          contract law as a result of a contractual commitment
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          under tort law as a result of commission of a tort (e.g. negligence),
          by cooperating with others to commit the tort.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Responsibility for the total amount awarded is shared by all. Failure by
      any of the parties to pay would increase the obligation of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a case where multiple defendants are involved in the commission of a
      tort, whether or not joint liability exists is determined by focusing on
      the ‘cause of action’ i.e. the acts that were committed that gave rise to
      liability in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>In the case that each of the intended defendants can be sued:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">on the same set of facts,</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          for the same liability (including through vicarious liability), then
          each of the defendants are joint tortfeasors. Where each is liable for
          a separate tort, and not the same tort, they are several tortfeasors.
        </li>
      </ul>
