    <p>
      An incident investigation aims principally to find out what caused the
      incident so that the organisation can learn from it and take steps to
      prevent recurrence. A civil claims investigation on the other had is going
      to be carried out when the organisation receives a ‘letter of
      notification’ (which puts the organisation on notice that a formal claim
      may be started), or if it has received a ‘letter of claim’, or where it is
      otherwise felt that such a claim may arise at some point in the future.
      The emphasis in a civil claim investigation would be on preparing for
      litigation. The report arising out of such an investigation may
      potentially attract legal privilege.
