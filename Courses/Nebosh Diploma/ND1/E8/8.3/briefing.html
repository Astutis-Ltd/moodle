    <p>
      If a criminal prosecution is seen as a possibility, the health and safety
      professional may be called upon to provide Management with information
      that will enable them to decide how to proceed. The safety professional
      may need to provide the following:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">details of the facts of the case</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          details of relevant legal requirements
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          an explanation of the ‘material breach’
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          an overview of the options available to the enforcing authorities
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          details of any proposed remedial action.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Facts of the case</span> - the safety practitioner
      must ensure that they do not speculate or provide inaccurate or incomplete
      information. The facts must be presented in an objective manner, with
      everything of relevance being disclosed, including facts that may appear
      to be critical of the way in which health and safety is managed in the
      organisation. The guiding ethical principles here are honesty and
      integrity, so the safety professional should relate the facts fearlessly.
      A failure to relate all relevant facts could compromise the management
      team’s ability to make decisions and may mean that the legal defence team
      receives less information than they should, which could harm a potential
      defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Relevant legal requirements</span> - the safety
      practitioner will need to identify what law is relevant to the situation
      and explain how the requirements should be applied in the context of the
      organisation’s undertakings. It is unlikely to be enough to simply list
      relevant law - management will need to understand how the requirements
      should have been met and what was actually done so that they can see
      whether they are likely to be found in breach or whether they may have a
      defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">The material breach</span> - this occurs where the
      HSE inspector believes there has been a contravention of health and safety
      law that is serious enough to require them to notify the person in
      material breach of that opinion in writing. Management should be briefed
      on what this is and the potential consequences of the breach in terms of
      the range of potential enforcement action that might be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should be familiar with the enforcement options available to enforcing
      authorities from your General Certificate studies.

    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Remedial action</span> - having set out the facts
      of the case and the relevant law, the safety practitioner may then be
      asked to brief management on appropriate remedial action that addresses
      the cause of the breach. Taking prompt, relevant and effective remedial
      action will of course help to remedy the circumstances that gave rise to
      the material breach. Doing so will also stand as a mitigating factor in
      the event the the organisation is convicted.
