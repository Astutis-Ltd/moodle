    <p>
      If an enforcement notice is issued, the safety practitioner will need to
      brief management on the effects of that notice and also on the grounds for
      appeal if the organisation believes that the notice was issued unfairly or
      in error.
    </p>
    <p>
      Applications to appeal are made to the Employment Tribunal and must be
      received by the Tribunal office within 21 days of the date on the notice.
      Grounds for appeal include:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the inspector interpreted the law incorrectly
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the inspector exceeded their powers under HSWA
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the breach of the law is admitted but the solution is not
          practicable/reasonably practicable
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the timescale set for compliance is too short, or
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">the breach was insignificant.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      In providing this information, the safety practitioner should be able to
      indicate which of the grounds for appeal may be relevant, and why.
