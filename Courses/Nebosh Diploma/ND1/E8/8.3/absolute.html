      The burden of proof in a criminal trial is higher than in a civil one.
      Generally in criminal trials, the prosecution will need to prove their
      case beyond reasonable doubt. However, in a health and safety trial,
      although the prosecution will still need to establish a prima facie breach
      of the law beyond reasonable doubt, it will then fall to the defendant to
      demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities, that they met the required
      legal standard of practicability or reasonable practicability as the case
      may be (see s40 Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974).
    </p>
    <p>
      Duties in health and safety law may be
      <span class="ast-bold">absolute</span> (i.e. must be done) or may be
      qualified. The two major qualifications of health and safety law are those
      imposed by the phrases <span class="ast-bold">‘practicable’</span> and
      <span class="ast-bold">‘reasonably practicable’.</span>

      The word ‘shall’ usually precedes an absolute duty indicating that it must
      be complied with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The employers’ duty to prepare a safety policy under Section 2(3) of the
      Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (HASAWA), is an absolute duty:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        Except in such cases as may be prescribed, it shall be the duty of every

        statement of his general policy with respect to the health and safety at
        work of his employees and the organisation and arrangements for the time
        being in force for carrying out that policy, and to bring the statement
        and any revision of it to the notice of all of his employees.

            In the case of
            <span class="ast-bold">Summers and Sons Ltd v Frost (1953)</span>
            Frost was a fitter who, having injured his thumb on the exposed part
            of a grinding wheel, sued his employer for damages for a breach of
            Section 14(1) of the Factories Act 1937 which stated:
          </p>
          <p class="ast-italic" style="padding-left: 10px">
            Every dangerous part of any machinery, other than prime movers and
            transmission machinery, shall be securely fenced unless it is in
            such a position or of such construction as to be as safe to every
            person employed or working on the premises as it would be if
            securely fenced.
          </p>
          <p>
            The House of Lords held that the duty was to provide fencing which
            absolutely prevented any part of any person working on the premises
            from coming into contact with any dangerous part of the machine, and
            that if this made the machine unusable then so be it!

    <p>
      More recently in the case of Stark v Post Office (2000) the nature of the
      absolute duty to maintain work equipment under Regulation 5(1) of PUWER
      was considered.

    <p>
      If a duty applies ‘so far as is practicable’ it is a less onerous duty
      than an absolute one. Practicable means feasible in the light of current
      knowledge and invention, i.e. if it can be done it must be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regulation 11 of PUWER requires employers to take effective measures to
      prevent access to any dangerous part of machinery, or to stop its movement
      before any part of a person enters a danger zone. Part (2) specifies a
      hierarchy of protective measures, commencing in (2)(a) with:
    </p>

            Mr Adsett sued his employer for compensation for pneumoconiosis,
            allegedly caused by exposure to foundry dust. K and L had installed
            a dust extractor plant in 1942. The system was new to the steel
            industry and had improved the foundry atmosphere.

            The Court of Appeal held that K and L had taken all practicable

      The term ‘reasonably practicable’ was considered by Lord Asquith in
      Edwards v National Coal Board (1949):

      <div class="ast-card__img-wrp ast-case-law">

          <p class="ast-italic">
            Reasonably practicable is a narrower term than ‘physically possible’
            and seems to me to imply that a computation must be made by the
            owner in which the quantum of risk is placed in one scale and the
            sacrifice involved in the measures necessary for averting the risk
            (whether in money, time or trouble) is placed in the other, and
            that, if it be shown that there is a gross disproportion between
            them the risk being insignificant in relation to the sacrifice the
            defendants discharge the onus on them. Moreover, this computation
            falls to be made by the owner at a point in time anterior to the
            accident.

    <!--Case Law End-->

    <p>
      <span class="ast-italic">Reasonably practicable</span> requires the degree
      of risk (likelihood × severity) of a particular activity or environment to
      be balanced against the costs (time, money and effort) of taking measures
      to avoid the risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater the risk, the more likely it is that it will be reasonable to
      go to very substantial expense, trouble and invention to reduce it. If the
      consequences and the extent of a risk are small, the same substantial
      expense would be considered disproportionate to the risk and it would be
      unreasonable to have to incur them to address a small risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The size and financial position of the employer are not taken into account
      in consideration of what is reasonably practicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although reasonably practicable is a lesser standard than practicable,
      Lord Reid (Marshall v Gotham & Co. Ltd. (1954)) in comparing the duties
      stated that:
