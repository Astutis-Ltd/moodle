    <p>
      The safety professional will have been appointed as the nominated
      competent source of health and safety assistance, in compliance with
      Regulation 7 of the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations
      1999.
    </p>
    <p>
      One aspect of competence is to know and understand the limits of one’s
      expertise. Safety practitioners should not attempt to advise on matters
      that are beyond their expertise; if they do, and the advice turns out to
      be wrong, the employer who acts on the advice may be in breach of the law.
      Not only could this result in disciplinary action against the safety
      practitioner but it could even result in the safety practitioner being
      investigated for a breach of s36 HSWA in that they caused the employer to
      be in breach. See, for example,
      <span class="ast-bold">R v Atterby (2009).</span>

          Richard Atterby was fined £1 000 and costs of £700, having pleaded
          guilty to an offence under Section 36(1) of the Health and Safety at
          Work etc. Act 1974 relating to his failure to make a suitable
          assessment to the risk to health of employees from a substance
          hazardous to their health.
        </p>
        <p>
          The court heard that the failure of George Farrar (Quarries) Ltd to
          make a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risk to the health of
          their employees from exposure to respirable crystalline silica,
          arising from the processing of sandstone, was due to the poor quality
          of Mr Atterby’s advice.
        </p>
        <p>The HSE Principal Inspector stated:</p>
        <p class="ast-italic" style="padding-left: 20px">
          “The health risks to stonemasons arising from exposure to respirable
          crystalline silica can be devastating. The risk assessment done by Mr
          Atterby was superficial and totally inadequate and it led to a high
          risk of exposure to respirable silica during stonemasonry work
          Consultants should not attempt to give advice on matters unless they
          have adequate knowledge, training, skills and experience to make the
          right decisions about risks and precautions that are needed.”

    <p>
      It follows that where the Management team need to be advised on a matter
      that is outside of the safety practitioner’s area of expertise, a suitably
      qualified, competent person should be engaged to provide that advice
      instead.
