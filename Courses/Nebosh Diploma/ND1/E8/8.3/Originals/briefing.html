      If a criminal prosecution is seen as a possibility, the health and safety
      professional may be called upon to provide Management with information
      that will enable them to decide how to proceed. The safety professional
      may need to provide the following:

    <p>
      <strong>Facts of the case</strong> - the safety practitioner must ensure
      that they do not speculate or provide inaccurate or incomplete
      information. The facts must be presented in an objective manner, with
      everything of relevance being disclosed, including facts that may appear
      to be critical of the way in which health and safety is managed in the
      organisation. The guiding ethical principles here are honesty and
      integrity, so the safety professional should relate the facts fearlessly.
      A failure to relate all relevant facts could compromise the management
      team’s ability to make decisions and may mean that the legal defence team
      receives less information than they should, which could harm a potential
      defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Relevant legal requirements</strong> - the safety practitioner
      will need to identify what law is relevant to the situation and explain
      how the requirements should be applied in the context of the
      organisation’s undertakings. It is unlikely to be enough to simply list
      relevant law - management will need to understand how the requirements
      should have been met and what was actually done so that they can see
      whether they are likely to be found in breach or whether they may have a
      defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The material breach</strong> - this occurs where the HSE inspector
      believes there has been a contravention of health and safety law that is
      serious enough to require them to notify the person in material breach of
      that opinion in writing. Management should be briefed on what this is and
      the potential consequences of the breach in terms of the range of
      potential enforcement action that might be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should be familiar with the enforcement options available to enforcing
      authorities from your General Certificate studies.

    <p>
      <strong>Remedial action</strong> - having set out the facts of the case
      and the relevant law, the safety practitioner may then be asked to brief
      management on appropriate remedial action that addresses the cause of the
      breach. Taking prompt, relevant and effective remedial action will of
      course help to remedy the circumstances that gave rise to the material
      breach. Doing so will also stand as a mitigating factor in the event the
      the organisation is convicted.
