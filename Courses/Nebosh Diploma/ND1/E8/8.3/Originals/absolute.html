      The burden of proof in a criminal trial is higher than in a civil one.
      Generally in criminal trials, the prosecution will need to prove their
      case beyond reasonable doubt. However, in a health and safety trial,
      although the prosecution will still need to establish a prima facie breach
      of the law beyond reasonable doubt, it will then fall to the defendant to
      demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities, that they met the required
      legal standard of practicability or reasonable practicability as the case
      may be (see s40 Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974).
    </p>
    <p>
      Duties in health and safety law may be <strong>absolute</strong> (i.e.
      must be done) or may be qualified. The two major qualifications of health
      and safety law are those imposed by the phrases<strong>
        ‘practicable’</strong
      >
      and<strong> ‘reasonably practicable’</strong>.

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Absolute duties</strong></p>
    <p>
      The word ‘shall’ usually precedes an absolute duty indicating that it must
      be complied with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The employers’ duty to prepare a safety policy under Section 2(3) of the
      Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (HASAWA), is an absolute duty:

            In the case of<strong> Summers and Sons Ltd v Frost (1953)</strong>
            Frost was a fitter who, having injured his thumb on the exposed part
            of a grinding wheel, sued his employer for damages for a breach of
            Section 14(1) of the Factories Act 1937 which stated:
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 20px">
            <em
              >Every dangerous part of any machinery, other than prime movers
              and transmission machinery, shall be securely fenced unless it is
              in such a position or of such construction as to be as safe to
              every person employed or working on the premises as it would be if
              securely fenced.</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The House of Lords held that the duty was to provide fencing which
            absolutely prevented any part of any person working on the premises
            from coming into contact with any dangerous part of the machine, and
            that if this made the machine unusable then so be it!
          </p>

    <p>
      More recently in the case of Stark v Post Office (2000) the nature of the
      absolute duty to maintain work equipment under Regulation 5(1) of PUWER
      was considered.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Practicable duties</strong></p>
    <p>
      If a duty applies ‘so far as is practicable’ it is a less onerous duty
      than an absolute one. Practicable means feasible in the light of current
      knowledge and invention, i.e. if it can be done it must be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regulation 11 of PUWER requires employers to take effective measures to
      prevent access to any dangerous part of machinery, or to stop its movement
      before any part of a person enters a danger zone. Part (2) specifies a
      hierarchy of protective measures, commencing in (2)(a) with:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px">
      <em
        >the provision of fixed guards enclosing every dangerous part or
        rotating stock-bar where and to the extent that it is practicable to do
        so...</em

            In the case of
            <strong>Adsett v K and L Steelfounders (1953)</strong> Mr Adsett
            sued his employer for compensation for pneumoconiosis, allegedly
            caused by exposure to foundry dust. K and L had installed a dust
            extractor plant in 1942. The system was new to the steel industry
            and had improved the foundry atmosphere.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Court of Appeal held that K and L had taken all practicable
            measures for the protection of their workmen known to be possible at
            the material time.

              and the sacrifice involved in the measures necessary for averting
              the risk (whether in money, time or trouble) is placed in the
              other, and that, if it be shown that there is a gross
              disproportion between them the risk being insignificant in
              relation to the sacrifice the defendants discharge the onus on
              them. Moreover, this computation falls to be made by the owner at

    <p>
      <em>Reasonably practicable</em> requires the degree of risk (likelihood ×
      severity) of a particular activity or environment to be balanced against
      the costs (time, money and effort) of taking measures to avoid the risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater the risk, the more likely it is that it will be reasonable to
      go to very substantial expense, trouble and invention to reduce it. If the
      consequences and the extent of a risk are small, the same substantial
      expense would be considered disproportionate to the risk and it would be
      unreasonable to have to incur them to address a small risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The size and financial position of the employer are not taken into account
      in consideration of what is reasonably practicable.

      Although reasonably practicable is a lesser standard than practicable,
