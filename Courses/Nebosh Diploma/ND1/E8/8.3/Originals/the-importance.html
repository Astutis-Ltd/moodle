    <p>
      Before deciding to prosecute, a prosecuting authority such as the HSE will
      need to be satisfied that doing so would be worthwhile and proportionate.
      Prosecutions are expensive to mount, so the HSE would not want to waste
      public money. In addition, the HSE would not want to gain a reputation for
      failing to secure convictions - such a reputation might undermine its
      effectiveness as an enforcement body. It is also necessary to check that a
      prosecution would be a proportionate response to the alleged offence, or
      whether a lesser degree of enforcement action such as the issue of a
      notice might be more appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to be satisfied that the prosecution is worthwhile, a two-stage
      test, known as the ‘Full code test’, can be applied.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first stage (the ‘Evidential stage’), the prosecuting authority
      (e.g. HSE, CPS) will need to satisfy itself that there is sufficient
      evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. As stated in the
      Crown Prosecution Service’s ‘Code for Crown Prosecutors’:

          based on the prosecutor’s objective assessment of the evidence,
          including the impact of any defence and any other information that the
          suspect has put forward or on which they might rely. It means that an
          objective, impartial and reasonable jury or bench of magistrates or
          judge hearing a case alone, properly directed and acting in accordance
          with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the
          charge alleged. This is a different test from the one that the
          criminal courts themselves must apply. A court may only convict if it
          is sure that the defendant is guilty."</em

      Deciding whether to proceed requires the prosecutor to consider the likely
      defence case and supporting evidence; it is at this stage that the
      prosecutor might conclude that the defence is too strong or that there is
      insufficient prosecution evidence to secure a conviction. If the case does
      not pass this ‘Evidential test’ then it will not proceed to trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the ‘Evidential test’ is passed, the prosecutor will move to stage two
      and consider whether prosecuting would be in the public interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second stage is known as the ‘Public interest stage’. For health and
      safety prosecutions, relevant ‘Public interest’ facts might include:

    <p>
      None of the above points are conclusive, nor is this an exhaustive list of
      factors for consideration. The prosecutor needs to exercise judgement when
      coming to a final decision about whether or not to proceed with a
      prosecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows from the above that good quality, persuasive defence evidence
      may have a significant influence on whether the accused is prosecuted at
      all. There is, therefore, an obvious benefit to being able to quickly and
      efficiently locate such evidence and disclose it to the prosecutor before
      such a decision is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the matter does come to court, having good defence evidence can cast
      sufficient ‘reasonable doubt’ on the prosecution case, such that the
      chance of being acquitted improves. If, however, the defendant has little
      or no supporting evidence, then a conviction becomes a distinct
      possibility given that the defendant will find it much harder to
      demonstrate that they did what was practicable or reasonable practicable
      as the case may be.
