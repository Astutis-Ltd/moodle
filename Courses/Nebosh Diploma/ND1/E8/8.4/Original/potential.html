    <br />
    <p>
      The role of the health and safety professional in protecting workers,
      employers and third parties, and the potential conflicts of interest that
      this brings was discussed in<strong> Element 6.1</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ‘Conflict of interest’ occurs when the aims of two parties are
      incompatible with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The IOSH Code of Conduct (at paragraph 1.4) addresses potential conflicts
      of interest. It requires safety professionals to
      <em
        >“Avoid conflicts of interest wherever possible and if one arises
        promptly take appropriate steps to manage it”.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      An example of a conflict of interest might be where the safety
      professional is asked to advise their employer on issues concerning a
      civil claim, and the claimant also asks for information or advice. The
      safety practitioner should avoid being in a position where they are
      giving, or appear to be giving, advice to both parties. In such a
      situation, the interests of the two parties are in conflict so it would be
      improper to assist both.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any legal action, the safety professional’s overriding duty will be to
      assist the court by giving clear and truthful evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The safety practitioner may have an interest in the outcome of the case.
      For example, they may wish to see their employer successfully defend the
      case, or perhaps they may have some personal sympathy with a claimant’s
      position and wish them to prevail. Such interests should not be allowed to
      interfere with giving honest and impartial evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some safety practitioners may find themselves giving ‘Expert witness’
      evidence. According to the IOSH Code of Conduct (at paragraph 1.4):

        <em
          >"Where you are acting as an expert witness in judicial proceedings
          the overriding objective will be to assist the decision-maker to deal
          with the case justly. If you take on the role of giving expert witness
          evidence, you should disclose any previous or continuing relationship
          that you have with any of the parties in the case at the time you are
          instructed and in any report prepared for the case."</em
        >
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      Giving evidence in legal proceedings where the party asking for your
      opinion is a friend or relative may give the impression of impropriety,
      even though the safety professional has disclosed their relationship and
      has satisfied themselves that they are giving their genuine opinion that
      coincidentally favours the relative or friend. Even if this is so, there
      is a danger that the safety professional’s objectivity may have been
      clouded by a sense of duty to their friend or relative. This may raise
      questions over the safety professional’s integrity and so such situations
      are best avoided.
