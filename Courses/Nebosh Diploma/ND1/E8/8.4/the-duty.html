    <p>
      The guiding principles of ethical conduct for safety professionals include
      honesty and integrity. There can be little doubt that interfering with, or
      altering, evidence in order to manipulate the outcome of legal proceedings
      is likely to be seen as dishonest and will raise profound questions over
      the integrity of the person involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be clear that no safety professional should ever interfere with,
      or alter, any evidence, especially where doing so is calculated to
      influence the outcome of legal proceedings. Instead, they should submit
      the evidence without alteration for the parties to litigation, and the
      court, to use and consider as they see fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The personal and professional consequences of interfering with, or
      altering, evidence can be severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interfering with evidence is a common law criminal offence known as
      ‘Perverting the course of justice’, the ingredients of which were set out
      by Pollock, B in R v Vreones, where it was said that:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        “The real offence here is the doing of some act which has a tendency and
        is intended to pervert the administration of public justice.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>Interfering with, or altering, evidence would be an example.</p>
    <p>
      Persons convicted of perverting the course of justice can receive lengthy
      prison sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, the Pre-Action Protocol in the Civil Procedure Rules, paragraph
      7.1.4 states:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        “[…] the defendant is under a duty to preserve the disclosure documents
        and other evidence (CCTV for example). If the documents are destroyed,
        this could be an abuse of the court process.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      An abuse of process can lead to the defendant’s statement of case (their
      defence) being struck out (CPR Rule 3.4(2)(b) ), meaning that the claimant
      will likely succeed, with the defendant being liable for costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professional consequences can include a requirement to face disciplinary
      proceedings from the practitioner’s professional body (e.g. IOSH). The
      outcome can range from being given advice on conduct all the way up to
      expulsion from the institution.
