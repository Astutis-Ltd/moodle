    <br />
    <p>
      In England and Wales, personal injury and ill health claims are managed in
      accordance with the relevant ‘Pre-action protocol’, the broad requirements
      of which were covered in <strong>Element 1.5.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The protocol advocates a “Cards on the table” approach, which involves
      encouraging “the exchange of early and full information about the dispute”
      (Personal Injury Pre-Action Protocol, para 2.1). Having ready access to
      the necessary information will help the defendant to comply with their
      obligations under the protocol. The court may impose sanctions where a
      party fails to comply with the protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the protocol applies only in England and Wales, the need to be
      able to locate information quickly is universal and will be needed
      wherever the claim is being brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being able to find relevant documents at an early stage and to quickly
      pass them on to the insurers and legal advisors gives the defendant more
      time to properly consider the claim and to decide how to respond. The
      alternative would be a situation where documentation and evidence that may
      have been of help has been lost over time and cannot be found; the
      defendant will be less able to defend the claim, which in a civil case
      only needs to be proved “on the balance of probabilities”. This may result
      in a claimant succeeding, which might not have happened had the defendant
      been able to present clear evidence to show that they did what was
      reasonable in the circumstances to manage foreseeable risks and to meet
      the duty of care expected of them.
