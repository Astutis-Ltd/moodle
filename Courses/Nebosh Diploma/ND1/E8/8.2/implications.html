    <p>
      After any witnesses have given their evidence, the coroner will summarise
      the case. Legal representatives may address the coroner at this point,
      although they won’t make speeches like they would in a civil or criminal
      trial. In an inquest into a fatal accident at work, the coroner will then
      address the jury on how they should apply the law when making their
      decision, and may tell the jury which of the possible conclusions that are
      normally available in a coroner’s inquest are open to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of a fatality at work, the following conclusions could be
      drawn:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">accidental death or misadventure</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">alcohol/drug related</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">industrial disease</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">natural causes</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">road traffic collision</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">suicide</li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          an open verdict – not enough evidence to draw one of the other
          conclusions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Although it is not the job of the coroner to apportion blame or to
      identify who may be guilty of an offence, if evidence suggests that
      someone may be criminally responsible for the death, then the coroner can
      pass that evidence to the police or Crown Prosecution Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      A coroner’s decision or inquest conclusion can be challenged. Simple
      matters, such as a decision not to call a particular witness, might be
      challenged during the inquest. More significant challenges may require an
      application for judicial review to the High Court. This must be done
      within 3 months of the decision or of the inquest ending.
