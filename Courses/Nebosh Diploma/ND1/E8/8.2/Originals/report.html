    <p>
      The investigation and subsequent inquest hearing may reveal that action
      could be taken to prevent future deaths. If this is the case, the coroner
      must write a report bringing this to the attention of an organisation (or
      person) who may be able to take action, such as the employer or the HSE in
      the case of a fatal accident at work. This is called a ‘Report to prevent
      future deaths’.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recipient of the report is obliged to send to the coroner a written
      response within 56 days. This response will say what action will be taken.
