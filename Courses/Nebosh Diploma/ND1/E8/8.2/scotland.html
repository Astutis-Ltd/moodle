    <p>
      There are no Coroner’s Courts in Scotland. Accidental, unexpected,
      unexplained, sudden or suspicious deaths are investigated by the
      Procurator Fiscal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Procurators Fiscal are qualified lawyers who are employed by the Crown
      Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) and who act on the
      instructions of the Lord Advocate. The Lord Advocate has responsibility in
      Scotland to investigate any death which requires further explanation. In
      other parts of the United Kingdom, this role would be undertaken by the
      coroner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event of a death due to an industrial accident in Scotland, a Fatal
      Accident Inquiry (FAI) will be held. This will be presided over by a
      Sheriff and will take place in local Sheriff courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      An FAI is a public court hearing that inquires into the circumstances of a
      death. The COPFS aims to hold FAIs as soon as practicable after a death.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the FAI, the circumstances surrounding the death will be assessed
      in order to identify any issues of public concern or safety and to prevent
      future deaths or injuries. The Procurator Fiscal will call witnesses and
      lead the evidence. Just as in the Coroner’s Courts, other interested
      parties may also be represented and can question witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of an FAI, a Sheriff will make a determination. The
      determination will set out:

        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      As with the coroner’s inquest, an FAI cannot make any findings of fault or
      blame against individuals.
