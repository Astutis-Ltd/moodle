    <p>
      A coroner is a special judge (usually a specially trained lawyer or
      doctor) who is charged with investigating unnatural deaths, such as those
      which occur at work. The coroner’s investigation may include an inquest
      hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coroner’s role is to establish the identity of the deceased and to
      find out how, when and where they died. Coroners do not make findings of
      guilt nor do they apportion blame, although they may be critical of what
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases the coroner may write a report aimed at helping to prevent
      further deaths in the future. This report is known as a ‘Report to prevent
      future deaths’ and will be sent to the organisations involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      An inquest is a fact-finding inquiry held in a court. It is up to the
      coroner to decide on the scope of the investigation and what evidence he
      or she wishes to hear. The coroner may also wish to visit the scene of the
      incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of a death that resulted from a “notifiable accident,
      poisoning or disease”, such as a fatal accident at work, the inquest will
      be held with a jury (s7, Coroners and Justice Act 2009). It is the jury’s
      job to decide the facts of the case and to say how the person died and the
      cause of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Present at the inquest may be certain ‘Interested persons’, a term which
      is defined in law (s47(2) Coroners and Justice Act 2009). Examples of
      interested persons include:

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          in a case where the death may have been caused by an injury received
          in the course of employment, or a disease prescribed under section 108
          of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (benefit in
          respect of prescribed industrial diseases, etc), a representative of a

    <p>
      Legal advice is not strictly required during an inquest but it may be
      prudent where enforcing authority representatives are in attendance and
      have their own legal representation.
    </p>
    <p>Interested persons have certain rights, including:</p>

    <p>
      Interested persons may be asked to give witness statements and to give
      evidence at the inquest. Evidence is given under oath. In the case of a
      fatal accident at work, any person from the workplace who can help the
      coroner to understand how the person died may be asked to give evidence,
      including:
