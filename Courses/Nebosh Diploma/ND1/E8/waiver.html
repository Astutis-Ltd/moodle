    <p>
      Waiver occurs where there is conduct that is inconsistent with maintaining
      confidentiality. The result of waiver is loss of confidentiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Privilege may be waived expressly or intentionally, whether in the course
      of litigation or otherwise, by a voluntary act of disclosure. The client
      may waive privilege, but so can the client’s lawyers, even if the client
      does not authorise them to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of the ways in which legal privilege might be waived include:

    <p>
      Cases of waiver of privilege are fact specific; it is for the court to
      decide whether or not privilege has been waived in any given situation.
      For instance, where a reference is made to privileged documents or advice,
      whether waiver has occurred will depend on the extent of the reference
      made. If the document or the fact that advice has been sought or given is
      simply mentioned in passing then this will not waive privilege. On the
      other hand, references to the substance of the document or to the advice
      itself may result in waiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      If privilege has been waived, it cannot be reasserted i.e. the client
      cannot request for a communication to be privileged once the privilege has
      been waived.

      The matter of litigation privilege was addressed in the case of
      <span class="ast-bold">R (on the application of) v Jukes [2018].</span>
    </p>

    <!--Blue Box - Multiple Paragraphs Start -->
    <div class="ast-blue-box-container">
      <div class="ast-blue-box-p ast-table__ctn__wrp__data__row-even">
        <p>
          Jukes (J) had been a manager at a waste recycling company when an
          employee had been killed after coming into contact with parts of a
          baling machine, access to which should have been protected by a door
          fitted with an interlock. The interlock had been bypassed, so the
          deceased had been able to access the dangerous parts of the machine
          with it still running.
        </p>
        <p>
          J was convicted under s7 HSWA, in that he had failed to take
          reasonable care for the health and safety of the employee who died. J
          appealed his conviction.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a part of his defence, J had stated that he had not been
          responsible for health and safety and that someone else had the role
          of health and safety manager. He said that he was unaware that the
          interlock had been bypassed. However, the prosecution’s case was that
          J had in fact been the health and safety manager at the relevant time
          and that he had been aware of the status of the interlock. The
          prosecution relied on a signed statement that J had given to the
          company’s solicitors in which he said that he had been responsible for
          health and safety at the relevant time.
        </p>
        <p>
          J argued that the statement which he gave to the company’s solicitors
          was privileged, so it should not have been disclosed to the
          prosecution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trial judge disagreed and the statement was duly made available to
          the prosecution. J was convicted.
        </p>
        <p>
          At appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that a document would only
          attract litigation privilege if the following conditions were met:
        </p>

        <ul style="margin-bottom: 20px" class="ast-list__bullet">
          <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
            litigation was in progress or reasonably in contemplation at the
            time when the document was made
          </li>
          <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
            the document was made or created with the sole or dominant purpose
            of conducting that litigation, and
          </li>
          <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
            the litigation was adversarial, not investigatory or inquisitorial.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          At the time that J provided his statement, matters were still at the
          investigatory stage and a criminal prosecution was not in reasonable
          contemplation. Sixteen months passed before he was interviewed by the
          police and the HSE.
        </p>
        <p>
          In any event, it was decided that the privilege being claimed was not
          J’s to start with - it was the company’s or the Managing Director’s as
          it was they who were the solicitor’s clients, not J. Therefore, as he
          was not the client, J was unable to rely on the company or the
          Managing Director’s litigation privilege for his own benefit.
        </p>
        <p>J’s appeal was denied.</p>
