      Following any accident at work, there is likely to be an investigation. An
      investigation can fall into one of two categories:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          an investigation that is conducted to find out what went wrong, learn
          the lessons, and prevent recurrence; or
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          an investigation conducted with the intention of responding to
          existing, pending or reasonably contemplated litigation.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      It is important that the investigation is carried out as objectively as
      possible because the investigation report may at some stage be disclosed
      to a claimantâ€™s legal advisor. This is especially true of the first type
      of investigation identified above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The investigation report should not speculate as to blame or legal
      liability, but should simply focus on the facts. Matters of legal
      liability are best left to the courts to decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be unwise to specifically admit liability in an accident
      investigation report. The author of the report should not rely on the
      possibility that the investigation report might attract legal professional
      privilege.
