    <p>
      An effective defence to a claim for damages depends on being able to
      demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities, that the measures taken by
      the defendant to control foreseeable risks were reasonable in the
      circumstances. The defence will be helped by having documentary evidence
      to show the court; this evidence should be held within an information
      management system.
    </p>
    <p>
      An information management system is used to collect and manage information
      and data, and make it accessible to anyone who needs it. As organisations
      grow and as time moves on, so the amount of information to be stored will
      increase. Without an effective information management system, information
      may become increasingly hard to find.
    </p>
    <p>
      When defending civil claims (as well as criminal prosecutions) it is
      imperative that the organisation has an efficient system for collecting
      and storing all kinds of health and safety and employment-related
      information so that, when called upon, it can be accessed quickly and
      efficiently. A failure to find and make available the required information
      may have serious consequences including:

      The list of documents of relevance to health and safety at work that may
      need to be disclosed to the claimant’s lawyers is very long. Examples
      might include, but will not be limited to:

      There may also be a need for information held by Human Resources such as
      back to work records, as well as purchasing records and receipts held by
      the accounts or purchasing department.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is therefore important to have a way of quickly and easily accessing
      all of this information in the event that an injured person decides to
      bring a claim. The quicker this information can be found, the quicker the
      company can decide how to respond.
