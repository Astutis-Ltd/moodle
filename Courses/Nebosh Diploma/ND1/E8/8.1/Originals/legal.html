    <p>
      In some circumstances, communications relating to accidents etc may
      attract ‘Legal professional privilege’. The concept of ‘Legal privilege’
      as it is known, is applicable to both civil and criminal law. It relates
      to confidential communications in whatever form (e.g. emails, text
      messages, reports, letters, memos, recordings etc) that the client wants
      to keep from opponents in litigation. However, not all documents will be
      ‘privileged’.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a complex area of law with many different circumstances where
      privilege may or may not apply. Privilege may also be waived, either
      intentionally or accidentally. It follows that advice should always be
      sought when considering whether legal privilege may be available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the best approach is always to assume that a communication may at
      some stage be disclosed to an opponent and to bear that in mind when
      committing ‘pen to paper’.

        <em>NB - </em>Historically, the concept known in England and Wales as
        Legal Professional Privilege has been known in Scotland as
        ‘Confidentiality of communications’. In recent years, however, the
        Scottish legal system has increasingly aligned itself with the
        terminology used in England and Wales.

      Legal privilege encourages frank disclosure of information between a
      client and their lawyer.

    <p>
      ‘The client’ will only include those individuals who are authorised,
      expressly or impliedly, to seek and obtain legal advice in relation to the
      particular matter under consideration, either from in-house or external
      lawyers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any person who does not fall into one of the above categories is unlikely
      to be classed as ‘The client’ even though they work for the organisation
      that has instructed the lawyer. Communications between such persons and
      instructed lawyers will probably not be privileged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The client does not need to worry that privileged information will be
      disclosed to someone else, since the lawyer is under a duty not to
      disclose it without the client’s consent. This will be true whether the
      communication is requested by a court, an opponent in legal proceedings,
      law enforcement or a regulator such as the HSE.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer’s duty not to disclose privileged information will continue
      even after proceedings have concluded; privilege even survives the death
      of the client and may continue to be claimed by personal representatives
      and successors.

    <p>
      There are two types of legal privilege - ‘Legal advice privilege’ and
      ‘Litigation privilege’.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Legal advice privilege</strong> applies to confidential
      communications specifically between a client and their lawyer; it does not
      extend to communications with third parties. The document must have been
      created for the <strong>dominant purpose</strong> of seeking and receiving
      legal advice in a relevant legal context.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a client could claim legal advice privilege where it asks its
      lawyer for advice on the legal implications of a suspected breach of
      health and safety law, or where it asks for advice on its legal position
      when faced with a civil claim for damages.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Litigation privilege</strong> can be claimed for any confidential
      communication, and evidence of those communications, between a lawyer and
      his or her client and a third party, or between a client and a third
      party. Crucially, this only applies where the
      <strong>dominant purpose </strong>of the communication is for use in
      existing, pending or reasonably contemplated litigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, an employee was injured whilst using machinery at work. The
      internal investigation raised concerns over potential criminal liability,
      so the company asked its lawyer to advise. The lawyer appointed a
      technical specialist to visit the site and to produce a report on whether
      there would be grounds for a regulator to prosecute. In principle, the
      report would be protected by legal privilege because its dominant purpose
      is for use in existing, pending or reasonably contemplated litigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The client may find it hard to claim privilege for documents that may not
      have been written in ‘reasonable contemplation’ of legal proceedings. For
      example, an accident investigation report may have been written with the
      intention of finding the cause of an accident in order to prevent
      recurrence. At the time of writing there was no ‘reasonable contemplation’
      of legal proceedings, so it would be hard to argue that the document was
      prepared for the ‘dominant purpose’ of litigation. In this case, privilege
      will likely not apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply marking a document as ‘Legally privileged’ does not automatically
      make it so. However, there is no harm in doing so and it may be helpful
      later on if the documents are effectively being written to obtain legal
      advice or to use in litigation.
    </p>
    In cases where there is existing, pending or reasonably contemplated
    litigation, it is helpful to speak to the company’s legal advisors at an
    early stage. Doing so will help the client to understand what is likely to
    attract privilege and what may not, and help them to set up the
    investigation in a manner that protects privilege as much as possible.
