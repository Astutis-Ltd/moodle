    <p>
      Following any accident at work, there is likely to be an investigation. An
      investigation can fall into one of two categories:

          width: 20px;

        an investigation conducted with the intention of responding to existing,
        pending or reasonably contemplated litigation.

    <p>
      It is important that the investigation is carried out as objectively as
      possible because the investigation report may at some stage be disclosed
      to a claimant’s legal advisor. This is especially true of the first type
      of investigation identified above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The investigation report should not speculate as to blame or legal
      liability, but should simply focus on the facts. Matters of legal
      liability are best left to the courts to decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be unwise to specifically admit liability in an accident
      investigation report. The author of the report should not rely on the
      possibility that the investigation report might attract legal professional
      privilege.
