      Claims are not always made immediately after an incident, while the event
      is still fresh in the memory. The Limitation Act 1980 allows time periods,
      known as ‘Limitation periods’, within which civil actions must be started.
      Examples of relevant limitation periods include:

    <p>
      There are no equivalent limitation periods in the criminal law; most
      health and safety prosecutions are without time limit so can be brought at
      any time, making the need to collect and maintain evidence to defend
      criminal prosecutions all the more important.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of personal injury and ill health claims, time starts to run
      from the ‘Date of knowledge’. This is usually the date when the injury
      becomes known or, in the case of a disease, the date of diagnosis. If the
      claimant is under the age of 18 then time does not start to run until
      their 18th birthday. Once the limitation clock starts to run, the claimant
      will have 3 years to issue proceedings i.e. to formally start their claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claimants sometimes leave it very late to start their claim. The
      implication for the employer is that nearly 3 years may have passed before
      it is made aware that it is being sued. The employer then faces the task
      of having to locate and consider a potentially large number of documents
      to help it decide whether or not to admit the claim, or to resist it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The need for an effective Information Management System becomes even more
      clear in the case of claims for illnesses that have long latency periods
      i.e. where exposure may have occurred many years in the past but the
      illness has only recently been diagnosed. In these cases the employer may
      need to recover documents from many years in the past. Without an
      effective way of managing this information its defence will be compromised
      from the outset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Memories fade over time so the ability to store and locate relevant
      evidence is crucial. A memory of an event that happened several years ago
      is unlikely to be as clear as it was at the time of the event or shortly
      thereafter, so is not likely to carry much weight in court. However, if
      this memory is supported by contemporaneous documentary evidence, the
      defendant’s position will be much stronger and could even lead to the
      claimant dropping their claim completely.
