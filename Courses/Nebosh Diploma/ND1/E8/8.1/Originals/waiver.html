    <br />
    <p>
      Waiver occurs where there is conduct that is inconsistent with maintaining
      confidentiality. The result of waiver is loss of confidentiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Privilege may be waived expressly or intentionally, whether in the course
      of litigation or otherwise, by a voluntary act of disclosure. The client
      may waive privilege, but so can the client’s lawyers, even if the client
      does not authorise them to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of the ways in which legal privilege might be waived include:

    <p>
      Cases of waiver of privilege are fact specific; it is for the court to
      decide whether or not privilege has been waived in any given situation.
      For instance, where a reference is made to privileged documents or advice,
      whether waiver has occurred will depend on the extent of the reference
      made. If the document or the fact that advice has been sought or given is
      simply mentioned in passing then this will not waive privilege. On the
      other hand, references to the substance of the document or to the advice
      itself may result in waiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      If privilege has been waived, it cannot be reasserted i.e. the client
      cannot request for a communication to be privileged once the privilege has
      been waived.

      The matter of litigation privilege was addressed in the case of
      <span><strong>R (on the application of) v Jukes [2018].</strong></span>
    </p>
    <div
      style="
        background-color: #f6ecff;
        width: 725px;

        Jukes (J) had been a manager at a waste recycling company when an
        employee had been killed after coming into contact with parts of a
        baling machine, access to which should have been protected by a door
        fitted with an interlock. The interlock had been bypassed, so the
        deceased had been able to access the dangerous parts of the machine with
        it still running.
      </p>
      <p>
        J was convicted under s7 HSWA, in that he had failed to take reasonable
        care for the health and safety of the employee who died. J appealed his
        conviction.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a part of his defence, J had stated that he had not been responsible
        for health and safety and that someone else had the role of health and
        safety manager. He said that he was unaware that the interlock had been
        bypassed. However, the prosecution’s case was that J had in fact been
        the health and safety manager at the relevant time and that he had been
        aware of the status of the interlock. The prosecution relied on a signed
        statement that J had given to the company’s solicitors in which he said
        that he had been responsible for health and safety at the relevant time.
      </p>
      <p>
        J argued that the statement which he gave to the company’s solicitors
        was privileged, so it should not have been disclosed to the prosecution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trial judge disagreed and the statement was duly made available to
        the prosecution. J was convicted.
      </p>
      <p>
        At appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that a document would only attract
        litigation privilege if the following conditions were met:

      <br /><br />
      <p>
        At the time that J provided his statement, matters were still at the
        investigatory stage and a criminal prosecution was not in reasonable
        contemplation. Sixteen months passed before he was interviewed by the
        police and the HSE.
      </p>

      <p>
        In any event, it was decided that the privilege being claimed was not
        J’s to start with - it was the company’s or the Managing Director’s as
        it was they who were the solicitor’s clients, not J. Therefore, as he
        was not the client, J was unable to rely on the company or the Managing
        Director’s litigation privilege for his own benefit.
      </p>
      <p>J’s appeal was denied.</p>
