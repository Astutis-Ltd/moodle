        The need to train managers regarding legal<br />professional
        privilege<br />
      </h2>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      As can be seen from ‘Jukes’, above, privilege belongs to the client, i.e.
      the party who instructs the lawyer or who is authorised to seek and obtain
      legal advice in relation to the particular matter. Therefore, managers who
      do not fall into this category are unlikely to be seen as being ‘The
      client’ so will not have the benefit of privilege even if they think they
      do. This fact should be impressed on managers to ensure that they are
      aware that anything they disclose could find its way to the opposing legal
      team. This includes the findings of accident investigations in
      circumstances where the investigation was not completed with the intention
      of defending pending or future litigation; as we have already seen, such a
      document is disclosable to the opposing legal team. The manager who wrote
      the report would, in effect, be a witness and could be questioned on the
      content of the report should the matter come to trial.
