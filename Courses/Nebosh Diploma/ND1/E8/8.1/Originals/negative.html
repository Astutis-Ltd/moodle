        Negative and positive consequences of<br />admitting liability<br />
      </h2>
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      The negative consequence of admitting liability in an incident
      investigation report would be that the organisation might find it harder
      to defend their legal position.
    </p>
    <p>
      There may be a positive consequence of admitting liability. In
      circumstances where it becomes clear that the employer has, on the balance
      of probabilities, been negligent, it may be pragmatic to admit liability
      at an early stage and seek to settle any claim. This will likely lead to a
      lower costs bill and may mean that damages paid could be less than what
      might have been awarded had the matter gone to court. It would also
      probably mean that the matter was dealt with more quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any event, the advice of the employerâ€™s legal advisor should always be
      sought whenever the issue of admission of liability is raised.
