      In 1931 Herbert William (Bill) Heinrich first presented an accident
      triangle to illustrate his theory of accident causation, showing that
      unsafe acts lead to accidents which largely result in minor injuries but
      will eventually result in major injuries or fatalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heinrich’s original triangle (below) was developed while working for
      Travellers Insurance and followed a study of over 5 000 cases. Heinrich
      stated that if the same type of accident occurred 330 times, on 300
      occasions there would be no injury, on 29 occasions there would be minor
      injuries, and on one occasion there would be a major injury.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1969 Frank Bird Jr., who was the Director of Engineering Services for
      the Insurance Company of America, undertook research into Heinrich’s
      findings. Bird was interested in determining what the actual reporting
      relationship of accidents was across a general population of workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bird analysed 1 753 498 accidents reported by 297 cooperating companies,
      representing 21 different industrial groups, and employing 1 750 000
      employees.
    </p>
    <p>Bird’s study revealed the ratios shown below.</p>

    <p>
      These and later triangles suggest that the outcome of an unsafe event in
      the workplace will typically be a ‘near miss’ but that a proportion will
      result in minor injuries and a smaller proportion still will result in
      major injuries or fatalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theory is useful in promoting the reporting of incidents (near misses
      and undesired circumstances) as, if the outcome of an event is largely
      dependent on luck, the lessons should be learnt from the event and not the
      outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      If incidents are reported and investigated, and lessons are learnt and
      improvements made, the likelihood of a serious injury occurring should be
      greatly reduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      However this theory is no longer universally accepted. There has been much
      conflicting research that suggests that accidents resulting in fatality or
      serious injury have different causal factors to those accidents that occur
      frequently and result in minor injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data set from Heinrichs study has been challenged regarding the
      likelihood of 10/11 reported incidents in the 1920’s being near misses.
      The ratio of outcomes for different events is also questionable. The ratio
      may make sense for falls on the same level but is unlikely to be
      representative of the outcomes from falls from height, for example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bird’s universal data set showing a ratio of outcomes for accidents of all
      types is even more problematic.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to extrapolate data from 1960’s manufacturing and
      industrial workplaces to the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It assumes that all near misses are of equal value and equal potential
      gravity, which is not the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are significant differences between minor and major accidents,
      notably regarding the activities undertaken, the potential levels of
      energy released and the characteristics and numbers of the safety barriers
      in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Andrew Hale (2002) noted, it is inappropriate to interpret accident
      causation triangles as implying that chipping away at the base of the
      triangle to stop minor incidents such as slips, trips and falls will have
      any impact on preventing process safety or major accidents, and as Marsden
      (2021) stated:

        People do not die because coffee drinkers are walking around with cups
        without lids. Similarly, minor accidents do not, in general, escalate
        into or (in high-hazard industries) predict major accidents.
