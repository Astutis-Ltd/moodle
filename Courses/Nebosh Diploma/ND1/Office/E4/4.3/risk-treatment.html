      Risk treatment is the process of selecting and implementing measures to
      modify the risk. It involves a cyclical process of:

      Risk treatments that deal with negative consequences are sometimes
      referred to as
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >‘risk mitigation’, ‘risk elimination’, ‘risk prevention’</span
      >
      and <span class="ast-italic">‘risk reduction’.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Risk treatment options are not necessarily mutually exclusive or
      appropriate in all circumstances. The options can include the following:

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          sharing the risk with another party or parties (including contracts

          retaining the risk by informed decision.

    <p>
      Selecting the most appropriate risk treatment option involves balancing
      the costs and efforts of implementation against the benefits derived, with
      regard to legal, regulatory, and other requirements, such as social
      responsibility and the protection of the natural environment. Decisions
      should also take into account risks which can warrant risk treatment that
      is not justifiable on economic grounds, for example: severe (high negative
      consequence) but rare (low likelihood) risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risk treatment itself can introduce risks. A significant risk can be the
      failure or ineffectiveness of the risk treatment measures. Monitoring
      needs to be an integral part of the risk treatment plan to give assurance
      that the measures remain effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risk treatment can also introduce secondary risks that need to be
      assessed, treated, monitored and reviewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      These secondary risks should be incorporated into the same treatment plan
      as the original risk and not treated as a new risk. The link between the
      two risks should be identified and maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of treatment options can be considered and applied either
      individually or in combination. The organisation can normally benefit from
      the adoption of a combination of treatment options.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ‘classic’ risk treatment options of avoid, reduce, retain, transfer
      are presented in the figure below in a risk evaluation matrix which
      indicates when each option may be appropriate.

      <p>Risk avoidance</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Risk avoidance involves making a strategic decision not to become involved
      in, or action to withdraw from, a risk situation. Withdrawing from an
      activity can be an important option in project management if it becomes
      clear that the costs of achieving the project objectives are too high or
      that the objectives might not be realised, regardless of cost. It should
      be noted that avoiding risks also means that potential opportunities for
      gain are also lost.

    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Risk reduction or optimisation (collectively risk modification) treatments
      are designed to optimise potential opportunities and minimise threats.
      Risk modification can involve changing:

      <p>Risk transfer</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      In the <span class="ast-italic">‘classic’</span> framework risks are
      considered to be transferred through insurance arrangements, contractual
      arrangements or partnerships and joint ventures. The notion of
      transferring a risk is slightly flawed in that if the insurance company or
      contractor go bankrupt or end up in court, the original risk is likely to
      still revert to the first party. In this context insurance is better
      described as a post-event compensatory mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term <span class="ast-italic">‘risk sharing’</span> is better used for
      partnerships and joint ventures where exposures and liabilities, and the
      potentials for gain are shared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risk retention pools would also fit into this category of risk sharing.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Risk retention</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Risk retention means making a conscious decision based on evidence from
      the risk analysis and evaluation to take no further action in response to
      a particular risk, for the time being. This may be because a residual risk
      is acceptable and no further worthwhile actions are available. The risk
      would need to be monitored forward and reviewed as necessary should
      circumstances change.
    </p>
    <p>
      All risks that are not avoided or transferred are retained by default.
      This is a viable strategy for small risks, where the cost of insuring
      against the risk would be greater over time than the total losses
      sustained.
