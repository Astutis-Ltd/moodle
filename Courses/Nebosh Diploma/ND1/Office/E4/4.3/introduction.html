      Risk (in the broader context of enterprise risk management) is defined in
      ISO 31000 – Risk Management Principles and Guidelines as: the effect of
      uncertainty on objectives.
    </p>
    <p>The following notes are offered in support of the definition:</p>

    <div class="ast-list">

        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          an effect is a deviation from the expected which may be positive
          and/or negative
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          objectives can have different aspects (such as financial, health and
          safety, and environmental goals) and can apply at different levels
          (such as strategic, organisation-wide, project, product and process)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          risk is often characterised by reference to potential events and
          consequences, or a combination of these
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          risk is often expressed in terms of a combination of the consequences
          of an event (including changes in circumstances) and the associated
          likelihood of occurrence.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Note also the link between risks and objectives. Risk management processes
      can most easily be applied when the objectives of the organisation are
      comprehensive and fully stated.
    </p>
    <p>Risk management is defined as:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        …co-ordinated activities to direct and control an organisation with
        regard to risk.

      Risk management is a central part of the strategic management of any
      organisation. It is the systematic process whereby organisations address
      the risks attached to their activities. A successful risk management
      framework should be:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          proportionate to the level of risk in the organisation
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          effectively aligned with other corporate activities
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          responsive to changing circumstances.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      Risk management is concerned with the assessment of significant risks and
      the implementation of suitable risk responses with the aim of achieving
      maximum sustainable value from all organisational activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effective risk management increases the probability of success and reduces
      both the probability of failure and the level of uncertainty associated
      with achieving the objectives of the organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The range of enterprise risks to be addressed by the management system is
      shown in the below figure.
