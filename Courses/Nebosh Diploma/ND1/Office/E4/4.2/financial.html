      (The UK Corporate Governance Code, Financial Reporting Council, July 2018)
    </p>
    <p>
      The context of the UK Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) was
      explained by the Cadbury Committee, on its creation in 1992:
    </p>

          Corporate governance is the system by which companies are directed and
          controlled. Boards of directors are responsible for the governance of
          their companies
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The shareholders’ role in governance is to appoint the directors and
          the auditors and to satisfy themselves that an appropriate governance
          structure is in place
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The responsibilities of the board include setting the company’s
          strategic aims, providing the leadership to put them into effect,
          supervising the management of the business and reporting to
          shareholders on their stewardship
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          The board’s actions are subject to laws, regulations and the

    <p>
      Corporate governance is about setting the values of the company and is
      distinct from the day-to-day operational management of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Code is based on the underlying principles of all good governance:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">

          focus on sustainable success over the longer term.

      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The latest version of the Code (2018) has an updated set of principles
      that emphasise the value of good corporate governance to long-term
      sustainable success. By applying the
      <span class="ast-bold">principles,</span> following the more detailed
      <span class="ast-bold">provisions</span> and using the associated
      <span class="ast-bold">guidance,</span> companies can demonstrate
      throughout their reporting how the governance of the company contributes
      to its long-term sustainable success and the achievement of wider
      objectives.
    </p>
    <p>The code is set out in five sections:</p>

      The Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial
      and Business Reporting (2014) which was originally published as the
      ‘Turnbull Report’ in 1999 offers advice on best practice on internal
      control for UK listed companies .
    </p>
    <p>
      The role of the board is to “provide entrepreneurial leadership of the
      company within a framework of prudent and effective controls which enables
      risk to be assessed and managed”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effective development and delivery of a company’s strategic objectives,
      its ability to seize new opportunities and to ensure its longer-term
      survival depend upon its identification, understanding of, and response
      to, the risks it faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The board has ultimate responsibility for risk management and internal
      control, including for the determination of the nature and extent of the
      ‘principal’ or ‘significant’ risks it is willing to take to achieve its
      strategic objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The board’s responsibilities for risk management and internal control are
      to:

    <!--List Bullet Start-->

          and internal control systems that identify the risks facing the

          principal risks;

    <p>
      The risk management and internal control systems should be embedded in the
      operations of the company and be capable of responding quickly to evolving
      business risks, whether they arise from factors within the company or from
      changes in the business environment. These systems should not be seen as a
      periodic compliance exercise, but instead as an integral part of the
      company’s day to day business processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When considering risk, the board should consider the following aspects:

    <p>
      Effective and on-going monitoring and review are essential components of
      sound systems of risk management and internal control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process of monitoring and review is intended to allow the board to
      conclude whether the systems are properly aligned with strategic
      objectives and to satisfy itself that the systems address the company’s
      risks and have been appropriately developed, applied and maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to on-going monitoring and review, the board should undertake
      an annual review of the effectiveness of the systems to ensure that it has
      considered all significant aspects of risk management and internal control
      for the company for the year under review, up to the date of approval of
      the annual report and accounts.
    </p>
    <p>The annual review of effectiveness should, in particular, consider:</p>
