      The HSE first published the discussion document Reducing risks, protecting
      people (R2P2) in May 1999 to set out how the statutory bodies responsible
      for the administration of the Health and Safety at Work Act should
      approach decisions about the management of risk that are required of them
      under the Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reducing risks, protecting people therefore influences the frameworks for
      proposing new legislation, Approved Codes of Practice (ACoPs) and
      guidance, and conducting research and providing information and advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The framework for decision making was based on the tolerability of risks
      (TOR) method which the HSE originally published in its 1988 guidance The
      tolerability of risks from nuclear power stations.

      <strong>Advances in knowledge on how people view risks</strong>

    <p>
      The factors that affect people’s perception of risk are now generally held
      to depend upon individual perception of how the risk relates to the
      individual and their personal values.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following factors have been identified as important regarding the
      perception of risks arising from man- made hazards:

    <p>
      Other studies have suggested that making decisions purely on a quantified
      risk basis is too simplistic and that in reality views of risk are shaped
      by human minds and cultures and are influenced not only by the prospect of
      physical harm but also other factors such as ethical and social
      considerations, and the degree of trust in those creating the risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      This might go some way towards explaining why high quality risk
      assessments, using all available data and best science and technology,
      conducted by leaders in the field often fail to reassure people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another model (the social amplification of risk model) has been used to
      explain why risks that are minor in quantitative terms, at times, produce
      massive reactions while major risks are often ignored. This model suggests
      that the impact of a particular risk begins with the initial victims and
      diffuses outward to society at large. In that process, public response to
      the risk can be amplified as a result of scientific challenges and
      over-dramatisation of the issue by the media using provocative terminology
      and images.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collectively the research establishes that hazards give rise to concerns
      which can be categorised as individual or societal concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Individual concerns</strong> address how individuals see the risk
      from a particular hazard affecting them and things they value personally.
      Individuals may be prepared to engage voluntarily in activities that
      involve high risks but as a rule are far less tolerant of risks imposed on
      them and over which they have little control, unless they consider the
      risks as negligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Individuals may also be willing to live with a risk if it secures them or
      society certain benefits, providing that the risks were kept low and
      clearly controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Societal concerns relate to the risks which impact on society and which,
      if realised, could have adverse repercussions for the institutions
      responsible for protecting people, e.g. the Government of the day. Typical
      examples relate to nuclear power generation, railway travel, or the
      genetic modification of organisms. People are more averse to such risks
      and are therefore more likely to insist on stringent Government
      regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazards giving rise to societal concerns share a number of common
      features:

      <strong>Criteria for reaching decisions</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Though all six stages are important, getting Stage 4 right (adopting an
      appropriate course of action) is crucial. Getting it right depends to a
      large extent on the criteria adopted for deciding whether a risk is
      unacceptable, tolerable or broadly acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research analysing the criteria used by regulators in the health, safety
      and environmental field has shown that, in general, the criteria can be
      classified according to three ‘pure’ criteria (equity / utility /
      technology).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Equity-based criteria</strong> start with the premise that all
      individuals have unconditional rights to a certain level of protection.
      This leads to standards, applicable to all, held to be usually acceptable
      in normal life. If the risk estimate derived from the risk assessment is
      above the limit and further control measures cannot be introduced to
      reduce the risk, the risk is held to be unacceptable whatever the
      benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Utility-based criteria</strong> apply to the comparison between
      the incremental benefits of the measures to prevent the risk of injury or
      detriment, and the cost of the measures (i.e. a cost benefit analysis
      comparing in monetary terms the relevant benefits (e.g. statistical lives
      saved, life-years extended) against the net cost of introducing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Technology-based criteria</strong> reflect the idea that a
      satisfactory level of risk prevention is attained when ‘state of the art’
      control measures (technological, managerial, and organisational) are
      employed to control risks whatever the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>Each approach, in isolation, has its limitations, for example:</p>

      The above figure illustrates the TOR framework. The triangle represents
      increasing level of ‘risk’ for a particular hazardous activity (measured
      by individual risk and societal concerns) moving from the broadly
      acceptable region at the bottom of the triangle towards the unacceptable
      region at the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lighter zone at the bottom represents a broadly acceptable region.
      Risks falling into this region are generally regarded as insignificant and
      adequately controlled. Regulators would not usually require further action
      to reduce risks unless reasonably practicable measures were available. The
      levels of risk in this region are comparable to those that people regard
      as insignificant or trivial in their daily lives, i.e. the risks from
      activities that are inherently not very hazardous or from hazardous
      activities that can be readily controlled to produce very low residual
      risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The darker zone at the top represents an unacceptable region. For
      practical purposes, a particular risk falling into that region is regarded
      as unacceptable whatever the level of benefits associated with the
      activity. Any activity or practice giving rise to risks falling in that
      region would, as a matter of principle, be ruled out unless the activity
      or practice can be modified to reduce the degree of risk or there are
      exceptional reasons for the activity or practice to be retained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The zone between the unacceptable and broadly acceptable regions is the
      tolerable region. Risks in this region are typically those that people are
      prepared to tolerate in order to secure benefits, providing that:

        the risks are periodically reviewed to ensure that they still meet the
        ALARP criteria (e.g. by ascertaining whether further or new control
        measures need to be introduced to take into account changes over time,
        such as new knowledge about the risk or the availability of new

      Benefits for which people generally tolerate risks typically include

      maintenance of general social infrastructure such as the production of
      electricity or the maintenance of food or water supplies.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the model is conceptual it must be stressed that the factors and
      processes that ultimately determine the tolerability of a risk is
      unacceptable, tolerable or broadly acceptable are contextual and dynamic
      in nature, i.e. they will be influenced by the particular circumstances,

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>Tolerability limits</strong></p>
    <p>
      The TOR framework can, in principle be applied to all hazards. When
      determining reasonably practicable measures for any particular hazard,
      whether the chosen options will effectively control the risk depends in
      part on where the boundaries are set between the unacceptable, tolerable
      or broadly acceptable regions.

        >Boundary between the ‘broadly acceptable’ and ‘tolerable’ regions for
        risk entailing fatalities</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The HSE believes that an individual risk of death of one in a million per
      annum for both workers and the public corresponds to a very low level of
      risk and should be used as a guideline for the boundary between the
      broadly acceptable and tolerable regions. When compared against background
      levels of risk (typically a risk of death of one in a hundred per year
      averaged over a lifetime) a residual risk of one in a million per year is
      extremely small.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p style="color: #3e3eff">
      <strong
        >Boundary between the ‘tolerable’ and ‘unacceptable’ regions for risk
        entailing fatalities</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The HSE does not have a widely acceptable criterion for this boundary,
      however in the guidance on ‘tolerability of risks in nuclear power
      stations’, the HSE suggested that an individual risk of death of one in a
      thousand per annum (p.a.) should on its own represent the dividing line
      between what could be just tolerable for any substantial category of
      workers for any large part of a working life, and what is unacceptable for
      any but fairly exceptional groups. For members of the public who have a
      risk imposed on them ‘in the wider interest of society’ this limit is
      judged to be an order of magnitude lower – at 1 in 10 000 p.a.
    </p>
    <p>
      As shown in the below table, the fatality rate for workers in even the
      most hazardous industries is normally well below the upper limit of a risk
      of death to any individual of 1 in 1000 p.a. for workers and of 1 in 10
      000 p.a. for the public who have a risk imposed on them ‘in the wider
      interest of society’.

    <p style="color: #3e3eff"><strong>ALARP and CBA</strong></p>
    <p>
      In most situations, deciding whether the risks are
      <span><strong>ALARP (as low as reasonably practicable)</strong></span>
      involves a comparison of proposed control measures and relevant good
      practice, which is defined as:
      <em
        >those standards for controlling risk that HSE has judged and recognised
        as satisfying the law, when applied to a particular relevant case, in an
        appropriate manner.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there is relevant, recognised good practice duty-holders are
      expected to follow it. Alternative measures can be taken if they are at
      least as effective in controlling the risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, such as with a new technology, where there is no relevant
      good practice, good practice should be followed as far as it can be, and
      then consideration given to whether there is any more that can be done to
      reduce the risk by going back to first principles to compare the risk with
      the sacrifice involved in further reducing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>‘First principles’ </em>comparisons can be done qualitatively, by
      applying common sense and / or exercising professional judgment or
      experience. For example if the costs are clearly very high and the
      reduction in risk is only marginal, then it is likely that the situation
      is already ALARP and further improvements are not required.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some instances (often in high hazard industries or where there is a new
      technology with potentially serious consequences) a more detailed
      comparison has to be undertaken. This is where a more formal
      <strong>Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) </strong>may provide additional
      insight to help come to a judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a CBA risk and sacrifice are converted to a common set of units (money)
      to enable direct comparison. Sacrifice is represented as a cost. Risk, in
      so far as it is being reduced, is considered a benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike in a standard commercial CBA where the rule is that the measure
      should be adopted only if benefits outweigh costs in ALARP judgments the
      measure must be adopted unless the sacrifice is grossly disproportionate
      to the risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many assumptions and uncertainties involved in CBA and the
      outcome of a CBA is only one of several considerations that go towards the
      judgment that a risk has been reduced ALARP. For example: in policy work
      and high hazards serious consideration should also be given to<em>
        ‘societal concerns’.</em
