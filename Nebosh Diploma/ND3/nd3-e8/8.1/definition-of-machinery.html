      (PUWER) originate from Article 114 and Article 153 Directives respectively
      (See image below). SMSR places duties on the supplier to ensure that the

      and is safe to supply. PUWER is concerned with worker safety and requires
      the employer to ensure that work equipment and machinery is safe for use.
      Consequently the technical safety requirements under Regulations 11 to 24
      of PUWER are consistent with the requirements of SMSR.

    <p>
      The principles of safety integration are a key part of the Essential
      Health and Safety Requirements (EHSRs) relating to the design and
      construction of machinery as defined in Annex 1 of the Machinery Directive
      / Schedule 2 of SMSR 2008.
    </p>
    <p>
      Machinery must be designed and constructed so that it is fit for its
      function, and can be operated, adjusted and maintained without putting
      people at risk when these operations are carried out as intended or when
      misused in any reasonably foreseeable way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aim should be to eliminate any risk throughout the foreseeable life
      cycle of the machinery, including transport, assembly, dismantling,
      disabling and scrapping.

    <p>
      Where misuse is reasonably foreseeable the machinery must be designed and
      constructed in such a way as to prevent abnormal dangerous use. Where
      appropriate, the instructions must draw the userâ€™s attention to the ways
      (which experience has shown might occur) that the machinery should not be
      used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design and construction should also take account of the constraints to
      which the operator is subject as a result of wearing / using personal
      protective equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Machinery must be supplied with all the special equipment and accessories
      essential to enable it to be adjusted, maintained and used safely.
