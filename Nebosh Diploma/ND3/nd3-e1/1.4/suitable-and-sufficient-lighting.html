        Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992
      </span>
      (as amended) requires every workplace to have suitable and sufficient
      lighting, which should so far as is reasonably practicable, be by natural
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suitable and sufficient emergency lighting should also be provided in any
      room in which workers are exposed to danger in the event of failure of
      artificial lighting.

    <p>
      Good lighting at work is important to ensure the efficient identification
      and avoidance of hazards in the workplace. Poor lighting can cause
      eyestrain, migraine and headaches, and is also linked to Sick Building
      Syndrome in new and refurbished buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good lighting should be visually comfortable and provide sufficient
      quantity of light, of a suitable quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different levels of lighting are required for different types of work. In
      general, the more detailed the task, the greater the light requirement. A
      process control room should be lit at an illuminance of 300 lux, a
      corridor or walkway may only require 50 lux, whilst studying an
      engineering drawing may require 750 lux.
