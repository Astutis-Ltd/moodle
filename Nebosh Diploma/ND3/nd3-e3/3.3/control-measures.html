    <p>
      The quantity of any dangerous substance stored or processed in plant and
      equipment should be kept as small as is reasonably practicable, having
      regard to the processes and operations being carried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plant and equipment should be designed, installed and operated to prevent
      the unintentional accumulation or build-up of dangerous substances and
      their flammable residues. Ductwork for flammable dusts should be designed
      to maintain adequate velocity throughout its length, with smooth inner
      surfaces and large radius bends. Suitable access points should be provided
      for inspection and cleaning.

    <p>
      Plant and equipment handling or storing dangerous substances should be
      designed to prevent any premature loss of contents during its expected
      life and during foreseeable operating and emergency conditions. The plant
      or equipment should be able to withstand foreseeable corrosion and
      abrasion during use, and be compatible with any dangerous substances that
      may be present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Work processes and operations should be designed to minimise the release
      of dangerous substances by using pipework, closed vessels and enclosed
      systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where dangerous substances are liable to be spilled, or to leak and give
      rise to a hazardous situation, the spill / leak should be contained or run
      off to a container or to a safe place, or otherwise treated to make it
      safe.

    <p>
      Adequate local exhaust ventilation should be provided to prevent or
      minimise releases into the workroom from access points, or openings, for
      charging or removing materials on plant and equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there may be a release of dangerous substances that could give rise
      to an explosive atmosphere, the plant, equipment or process should be
      enclosed within a cabinet, or other suitable enclosure, and provided with
      mechanical ventilation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isolation valves should be provided to minimise leaks after use, to
      control leaks during use, and to enable safe isolation of the plant for
      maintenance.

    <p>
      Work equipment should be designed, constructed and maintained to ensure it
      cannot unintentionally ignite hazardous concentrations of dangerous
      substances, which may arise either in the workplace or within the
      equipment itself.

    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Many chemical substances can give rise to harmful physical effects by
      generating heat and / or generating pressure from released gases and / or
      vapours following self-reaction, reaction with air or moisture, or
      reaction with other chemical substances. They may also release other
      flammable or toxic substances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plant used for chemical reaction processes should be designed,
      constructed, provided with sufficient monitoring and control, and operated
      so as to avoid any adverse conditions that could allow dangerous
      substances to give rise to hazardous heat and pressure effects, such as
      the uncontrolled release of the plant contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chemical reaction hazard assessment should be undertaken to consider:
