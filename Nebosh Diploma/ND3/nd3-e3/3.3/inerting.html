    <p>
      Inerting is an approach to preventing explosions / the formation of an
      explosive atmosphere through the reduction of oxygen levels. In a
      substantially closed system the oxygen content of the atmosphere within
      the plant can be controlled at a safe level (below the lower explosive
      limit). The maximum safe oxygen content will vary with the type of inert
      gas and the chemical reactivity of the material being processed. It will
      need to be determined experimentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inerting is only likely to be effective in a fully-enclosed system with a
      minimum number of places where air can enter. The likelihood of air
      entering when process materials are added to or removed from the system
      needs to be considered. If it is likely, a purge cycle will be needed
      before the process restarts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many factors will influence the overall reliability of an inerting system,
      including:

    <p>
      If the plant is held at a pressure slightly above atmospheric, air leaks
      into the system can be avoided, however the risk of asphyxiation from the
      inert gas, should it accumulate in the general atmosphere of the workroom,
      would need to be considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sufficient reserve of inert gas is required to ensure that the plant can
      be shut down safely if a seal failure or similar unexpected leak occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advanced inerting systems (explosion suppression barriers â€“ Figure 2.22)
      are similar to suppressors used for major items of plant. A suppression
      barrier involves linking a pressure or optical detector to a rapid-acting
      device designed to inject an inerting or suppressing material into a duct.
