    <p>
      The basic approach to preventing dust explosions is to prevent the sides
      of the ‘dust explosion pentagon’ coming together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Engineering solutions should be implemented to eliminate ignition sources
      caused by mechanical failures, overheating of bearings and drive belts
      (condition monitoring and planned preventative maintenance), sparks from
      tramp metal (X-rays and magnetic metal recovery systems), electrical
      sparks (specification of equipment suitable for use in flammable
      atmospheres) and static electricity (earthing and equipotential bonding).
    </p>
    <p>
      Dust generation should be eliminated or controlled through specifying
      different materials, pneumatic dust collection, and good housekeeping /
      vacuuming to address settled dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oxygen levels can be kept below levels that could sustain combustion
      through enclosure and inerting, notably at points where dusts or powders
      are transferred into flammable liquids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitigatory measures to limit the damage / consequences of a dust cloud
      explosion include site layout design to ensure the separation and
      segregation of high-risk areas and the specification of explosion
      suppression and venting systems as discussed in section 4 of this element.

      The suitability of work equipment generally is discussed in more detail in
      Element 7.

    <p>
      The suitability of electrical equipment for use in hazardous environments
      including flammable/explosive atmospheres is discussed in more detail in
      Element 5. Electrical equipment for use in potentially flammable /
      explosive is discussed in more detail in Element 5. Electrical equipment
      for use in potentially flammable / explosive atmospheres are designed and
      constructed to ensure that the risks of ignition from hot surfaces and
      sparks etc. are eliminated or reduced.
