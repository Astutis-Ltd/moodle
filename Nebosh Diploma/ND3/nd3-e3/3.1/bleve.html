    <p>
      A BLEVE (ble-vee) occurs when a tank containing a liquid, held above its
      atmospheric pressure boiling point ruptures, resulting in the explosive
      vapourisation of a large portion of the tank contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most dramatic BLEVEs occur from failure of LPG cylinders in a fire.

    <p>
      The effects of a BLEVE involving flammable liquids are: a major fireball
      as vapour and liquid droplets are ignited, thermal radiation, flying
      debris (tank shrapnel), and flying droplets of burning fuel which can
      cause secondary fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the contents are not flammable (steam, for example) a simple mechanical
      explosion occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the tank rupture is caused by impact, rather than fire, a vapour cloud
      will be released which may result in an Unconfined Vapour Cloud Explosion
      (UVCE).

        <p class="ast-bold">Mexico City, 1984</p>
        <p>
          The PEMEX LPG Terminal at San Juan Ixhuatepec, Mexico City suffered a
          major fire and a series of catastrophic explosions starting at 05:35
          on the 19 November 1984.
        </p>
        <p>
          The events killed 500 people and completely destroyed the terminal.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time of the accident the plant was being filled from a refinery
          400 km away, as on the previous day it had become almost empty. Two
          large spheres and 48 cylindrical vessels were filled to 90% and 4
          smaller spheres to 50% full.
        </p>
        <p>
          A drop in pressure was noticed in the control room and also at a
          pipeline pumping station. The cause of the pressure drop could not be
          identified at the time (an 8-inch pipe between a sphere and a series
          of cylinders had ruptured) so the release of LPG continued. The
          resulting gas cloud (measuring approx. 200m x 150m x 2m) drifted to a
          flare stack where it ignited. The UVCE caused violent ground shock and
          a number of fires.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plant workers tried to deal with the escape, taking various actions.
          At a late stage somebody pressed the emergency shut-down button.
        </p>
        <p>
          About fifteen minutes after the initial release the first BLEVE
          occurred. For the next hour and a half there followed a series of
          BLEVEs as the LPG vessels violently exploded. LPG was said to rain
          down and surfaces covered in the liquid were set alight. The
          explosions were recorded on a seismograph at the University of Mexico.
        </p>
        <p class="ast-bold">Failings in technical measures</p>
        <p>
          The total destruction of the terminal occurred because there was a
          failure of the overall basis of safety which included the layout of
          the plant and emergency isolation features.
        </p>
        <p>
          The terminalâ€™s fire water system was disabled in the initial blast.
          Also the water spray systems were inadequate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The installation of a more effective gas detection and emergency
          isolation system could have averted the incident. The plant had no gas
          detection system and therefore when the emergency isolation was
          initiated it was probably too late.
        </p>
        <p>
          The traffic chaos, which built up as local residents sought to escape
          the area hindered the arrival of the emergency services.
