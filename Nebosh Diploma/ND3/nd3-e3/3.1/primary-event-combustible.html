    <p>
      During the 3 to 4 days preceding the incident, workers were clearing sugar
      lumps lodged in the Silo 1 sugar discharge holes above the steel belt,
      using steel rods to break and dislodge the sugar lumps. Workers also used
      access ports located on the discharge chutes to break lumps that lodged on
      the steel belt, blocking sugar flow from the upstream discharge chutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Silo 1 ‘rodding’ activities, sugar continued to flow from Silo
      2 onto the steel belt upstream of the Silo 1 discharge chutes, lodging
      between the moving steel belt and one or both Silo 1 discharge chutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sugar lumps small enough to enter the discharge chute, but too large to
      pass between the end of the chute and the steel belt, then created a
      ‘dam’. This caused sugar travelling from Silo 2 to spill off the steel
      belt, upstream of the Silo 1 discharge chute, and accumulate inside the
      covered conveyor, covering parts of the steel belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sugar dust released into the air from the sugar spilling off the conveyor,
      and sugar dust generated as the steel belt travelled through the sugar
      pile, accumulated in the unventilated enclosure.

    <p>
      The CSB (US Chemical Safety Board) investigation concluded that the
      initiating event was most likely the ignition of an explosive
      concentration of sugar dust within the steel belt enclosure under Silos 1
      and 2. Multiple possible ignition sources (such as electrical sparks, hot
      surfaces, or friction) were identified during examination of the damaged
      steel belt and discussions with operations and maintenance personnel.
      However, the extent of the destruction from the explosions and
      long-burning fires prevented identifying a likely ignition source for the
      primary explosion.

          The primary dust explosion in the silo tunnel sent overpressure waves
          into the three silo pantleg rooms, and then out into the first floor
          of the Bosch building. Explosion pressure waves travelled between
          Silos 1 and 2 and exited into the south stairwell, blowing the brick
          walls out into the packing building. Sugar dust accumulations on
          elevated surfaces, and spilled sugar on the floors around the
          packaging equipment, contributed to the explosion energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fireballs continued to be fuelled by sugar dust dislodged from
          overhead equipment. Powdered and granulated sugar added fuel, as sugar
          was thrown into the air by the advancing pressure waves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spilled sugar that had accumulated on the floors around conveyors and
          packaging equipment rained into the rooms below, adding more fuel to
          the advancing fireballs.

    <p>
      The CSB investigation described the causal chain of events as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Sugar and cornstarch conveying equipment was not designed or maintained to
      minimise the release of sugar dust into the work area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inadequate housekeeping practices resulted in significant accumulations of
      combustible sugar and sugar dust on the floors and elevated surfaces
      throughout the packing buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Airborne combustible sugar dust accumulated above the minimum explosible
      concentration inside the newly enclosed steel belt assembly under Silos 1
      and 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      An overheated bearing in the steel belt conveyor most likely ignited a
      primary dust explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary dust explosion inside the enclosed steel conveyor belt under
      silos 1 and 2 led to massive secondary dust explosions and fires
      throughout the packing buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 14 fatalities were most likely the result of the secondary explosions
      and fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emergency evacuation plans, emergency evacuation drills, and the means of
      notifying workers to evacuate were all inadequate.
