    <p>
      Extinguishers should be located in conspicuous positions on brackets or
      stands where they will be readily seen by persons following an escape
      route, but not where a potential fire might prevent access to them.
      Suitable locations include: near to room exits, corridors, stairways,
      lobbies and landings.
    </p>
    <p>
      A record should be kept, on a plan, of the type, number and location of
      the extinguishers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Small extinguishers (&lt;4 kg) should be mounted so that the handle is
      approx. 1.5 m from the floor. For larger, heavier extinguishers this
      should be about 1 m from the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy extinguishers should not pose a risk of injury by being dislodged.
      Suitable brackets should be used, if necessary, to hold the extinguisher
      in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extinguishers should be available for immediate use at all times. It
      should not be necessary to travel more than 30 m from the site of the fire
      to reach an extinguisher (20 m in higher risk situations). Similar
      positions on each floor are advisable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extinguishers should not be placed in concealed positions behind doors, in
      cupboards or deep recesses, or in positions where they might cause
      obstruction to exit routes or be damaged by trolleys. They should also not
      be placed over or close to heating appliances. If the view of an
      extinguisher is obscured, its position should be indicated by suitable
      signs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extinguishers provided to deal with special fire risks should be sited
      near to the fire risk concerned, but not so near as to be inaccessible, or
      place the operator in undue danger in case of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operation of extinguishers is affected by temperature. Extinguishers
      are marked with the temperature range within which they will perform
      satisfactorily and should not be exposed to storage temperatures outside
      the marked range.

      All portable fire extinguishers will require periodic inspection,
      maintenance and testing by a competent person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on local conditions, such as the likelihood of vandalism or the
      environment where extinguishers are located, carry out brief checks to
      ensure that they remain serviceable. In normal conditions a monthly visual
      check by a competent person should be appropriate. Local environmental
      conditions or risk of vandalism may dictate more frequent checks.

    <p>
      The responsible person should also ensure that extinguishers, along with
      any spare gas cartridges and replacement charges, are maintained
      regularly. Basic servicing of all extinguishers should be conducted
      annually. An extended service of water and powder extinguishers should be
      undertaken every five years. An overhaul of gas extinguishers should be
      conducted every ten years.

      Decisions will need to be made regarding who is expected to use PFE. This
      may be emergency response team members, staff with specific
      responsibilities such as fire marshals, or staff in an area with a
      specific fire risk. It is unlikely that all staff would be expected to use
      PFE.
