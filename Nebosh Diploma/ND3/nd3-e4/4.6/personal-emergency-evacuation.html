    <p>
      Disabled workers cannot be put at a substantial disadvantage by a
      provision, criterion or practice of their employer. The employer has a
      duty to make reasonable adjustments to ensure, so far as is reasonable,
      that a disabled person has the same access to everything that is involved
      in getting and doing a job as a non-disabled person.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan (PEEP) is an individual plan,
      tailored to the needs of a disabled employee (also regular visitors or
      service users) that defines the route the person is likely to take, and
      what support they will need in the event of an evacuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrangements for occasional disabled visitors or service users can be made
      within standard evacuation plans, and offered to disabled visitors as part
      of the reception procedure.
