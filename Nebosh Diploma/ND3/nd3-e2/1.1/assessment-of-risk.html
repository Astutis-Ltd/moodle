    <p>
      The Management of health and
      <span class="ast-italic"> Safety at Work Regulations</span> requires a
      suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks for all work activities
      for the purpose of deciding what measures are necessary for safety. For
      work in confined spaces this means identifying the hazards present,
      assessing the risks and determining what precautions to include in the
      safe system of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key factors to include in the assessment of the risks associated with
      a confined space entry include:

      <p>Access arrangements</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Where confined spaces are designed and constructed the designer should
      ensure that the need to enter confined spaces both during normal work, or
      for cleaning and maintenance is eliminated where possible or otherwise
      minimised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where entry is required the design should incorporate easy access, taking
      account of requirements in the event of emergencies. Where possible access
      points should be sited at the bottom or low down in the structure. Where
      working at height cannot be avoided, the provision of safe means of access
      such as ladders, and safe working platforms must be carefully addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The size of access point openings should be sufficiently large and free
      from obstruction to allow the passage of people wearing the necessary
      protective clothing and equipment, and to allow adequate access for rescue
      purposes.
    </p>

      <p>Likely atmospheres</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      A lack of oxygen due to chemical reactions or displacement with other
      gases presents a risk of oxygen deprivation and ultimately asphyxiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too much oxygen, e.g. from cylinder leaks or chemical reactions presents
      risks of oxidation reactions, fire or explosions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other chemical gases, fumes and vapours may present risk of chemical
      asphyxiation or have other toxic effects or present physico-chemical
      hazards of increased flammability or explosibility.
    </p>
    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>The task to be undertaken</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Hazards that arise directly from the work to be undertaken in the confined
      space must be carefully risk assessed. The work itself may introduce the
      hazard into the confined space, e.g. use of cleaning chemicals,
      introduction of ignition sources or increased temperatures from hot-work
      on the internal or external surfaces of the confined space. Other hazards
      such as noise may be exacerbated within a confined space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, conditions may become hazardous when work is done in
      conjunction with residues, contamination etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The confined space may negatively impact on working posture. Totally
      enclosed spaces may also have poor lighting.
    </p>
    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Materials, equipment and substances to be used</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Depending on the nature of the confined space electrical equipment and
      other tools may need to be suitable for use in a potentially flammable
      atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Materials need to be able to be safely handled into the confined space and
      to the point of work within it. Flammable and combustible materials should
      not be stored in confined spaces that have not been specifically created
      or allocated for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Care must be taken to ensure specified substances will not give off toxic,
      flammable or explosible vapours on their own or in combination with any
      residual chemical that may be present in the confined space.
    </p>
    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>People at risk</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      As with any ‘suitable and sufficient’ risk assessment the impact of the
      hazard on vulnerable groups and individuals must be considered. To work
      effectively in confined spaces workers will need to be in good general
      health, able to move well in restricted spaces, able to use respiratory
      protective equipment, not have any psychological difficulties with
      confined spaces (claustrophobia) and possibly height and darkness.

    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Given the potential for loss of life both hardware and software control
      measures for specified and other significant risks require careful
      consideration. Equipment for safe access, lighting and other electrical
      equipment, pumps for controlling water levels or providing clean air, and
      equipment for isolating and locking-ff energy sources, chemical feeds etc,
      should all be properly specified, maintained in safe working order, and
      regularly inspected and tested. Back-up equipment may need to be
      available.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are any concerns regarding breathable oxygen levels or the
      presence of seriously toxic substances in the air breathing apparatus
      should be specified to guarantee a supply of breathable air.
    </p>
    <p>
      A safe system of work needs to be in place (discussed later) and in high
      hazard confined spaces Permits to Work may need to be used.
