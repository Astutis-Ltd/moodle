    <p>
      When selecting work equipment, employers should take account of ergonomic
      risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ergonomics is concerned with the interaction of humans and other elements
      of a system, and the design of such systems in order to optimise human
      well-being and overall system performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      This involves designing the system to fit the human and to compensate for
      physiological or psychological weaknesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthropometric principles should be applied to ensure that operating
      positions, working heights, reach distances, etc. accommodate the intended
      operators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biomechanical and physiological analysis ensures that operators are not
      expected to exert undue force or stretch or reach beyond their normal
      strength or physical limitations. This is particularly important for
      highly repetitive work.

    <p>
      The general principles of the Essential Health and Safety Requirements
      (EHSRs) in
      <span class="ast-italic">
        Annexe 1 of the Machinery Directive (as presented in Schedule 2 of the
        Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 2008
      </span>
      – SMSR) state that when machinery is being designed, there are a number of
      principles that should be taken into account, depending on the results of
      the risk assessment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the intended conditions of use, the discomfort, fatigue and physical
      and psychological stress faced by the operator must be reduced to the
      minimum possible, taking into account ergonomic principles such as:
