    <p>
      Pressure systems are ‘work equipment’ and as such must comply with the
      requirements of PUWER, including Regulation 6 (Inspection) as discussed
      earlier in section 7.3.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the safety of work equipment depends upon installation conditions or
      can be affected by deterioration due to environmental conditions the
      equipment should be inspected before first use and periodically thereafter
      to ensure that deterioration over time does not give rise to dangerous
      situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: these concerns should be identified through general risk assessment
      as required by Regulation 3 of the
      <span class="ast-italic">
        Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular inspections are required wherever work equipment is of a type
      where the safe operation is critically dependent on its condition in use
      and deterioration would lead to a significant risk to the operator or
      other worker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extent of the inspection required will depend on the potential risks
      from the work equipment. Inspection should include, where appropriate,
      visual checks (e.g. pre-use), functional checks and tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspections under Regulation 6 of PUWER are only required where the
      statutory examination under the
      <span class="ast-italic"> Pressure Systems Safety Regulations 2000</span>
      (PSSR) do not fully cover all the significant health and safety risks
      which are likely to arise from the use of the equipment, in a way that
      satisfies the requirements of PUWER.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regulation 8 of PSSR requires the user of an installed system / owner of a
      mobile system to ensure that a Written Scheme of Examination (WSE) has
      been prepared before a pressure system is operated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The WSE should be drawn up by a competent person, or if drawn up by
      someone other than a competent person certified as suitable by a competent
      person and should specify the nature and frequency of inspection of the
      following system parts:
