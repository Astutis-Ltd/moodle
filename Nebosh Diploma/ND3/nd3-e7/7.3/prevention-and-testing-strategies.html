      that nothing about the way in which it is modified or repaired gives rise
      to danger or otherwise impairs the operation of any protective device or

    <p>
      Repair or modification of non-pressure containing parts of the system

      operation of any protective devices is not adversely affected.

    <p>
      Any repair or modification (including extensions or additions) should be
      designed in accordance with appropriate standards, taking into account the
      expected future duty of the system as well as the original design
      specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      All work should be done by a competent person, or following consultation
