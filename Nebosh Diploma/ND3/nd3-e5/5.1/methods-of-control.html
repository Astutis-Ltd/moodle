    <p>
      Process control includes the use of sensors, alarms, trips and other
      control systems that either take automatic action, or allow for manual
      intervention to prevent the conditions for uncontrolled reaction
      occurring.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thorough understanding of the chemical process involved and the limits
      of safe operation is required to confidently specify process control
      measures.
    </p>
    <p>Variables to be controlled include:</p>

          undesired exothermic reaction starts and the operating temperature

    <p>
      Protective measures do not prevent a runaway but are intended to reduce
      the consequences should one occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are rarely used on their own as some preventive measures are normally
      required to reduce the demand upon them.
