    <p>
      Emergency plans should include procedures for determining whether an
      emergency has occurred, and when to activate the plan in response to an
      emergency. This should include identifying an appropriately trained person
      who will take the decision, in consultation with others, on when an
      emergency has occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emergency planning should look beyond the immediate response and long-term
      recovery issues, and also look at secondary impacts including media
      attention and public interest.

      Media interest and involvement in an emergency will result in efforts to
      gather newsworthy information, and the dissemination of that information
      via the various news media (television, radio, internet and print).
    </p>
    <p>
      A key individual should be identified to act as media coordinator to
      manage a steady stream of accurate information and ensure that key
      information is released at appropriate times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Local television and radio stations can play an important role in
      broadcasting emergency information to the local community.
