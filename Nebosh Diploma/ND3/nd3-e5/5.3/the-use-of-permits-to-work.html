      A permit-to-work (PTW) is a document issued by an authorised person to
      permit work to be carried out safely in a defined area under specified
      conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of an explosive atmosphere presents a significant hazard that
      that warrants the additional administrative control offered by a PTW.
      Examples of activities that should be controlled by PTW when undertaken in
      a hazardous area include:

          Hot work (e.g. welding, cutting or similar operations carried out on
          vessels containing flammable vapour or liquid residues)

    <p>
      PTW’s are formal management documents that should only be issued by those
      with clearly assigned authority to do so. The requirements stated in them
      must be complied with before the permit is issued and the work covered by
      it is undertaken. Individual PTW’s need to relate to clearly defined
      individual pieces of work and should normally include:

      <h5>Principles of pressurisation and purging</h5>

    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Ex p (purge / pressurised protection) is intended to prevent the explosive
      atmosphere from contacting the ignition source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purge protection involves maintenance of a constant flow of air (or an
      inert gas) to dilute and take away any potentially explosive atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pressure protection ensures that the pressure inside an enclosure is
      sufficient to prevent the entrance of a flammable gas, vapour, dust, or
      fibre and prevent a possible ignition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supply of purging and pressurising air is managed by a special control
      unit. An advantage of purging and pressurising is that this protection
      concept also accommodates possible internal releases of flammable gas,
      vapour or liquid. This is relevant for analysers or other equipment that
      have a flammable liquid or gases passing through it.
