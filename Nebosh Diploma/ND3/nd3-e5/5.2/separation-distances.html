    <p>
      Separation distances will depend on various factors, most important of
      which is the capacity of the tank. Guidance distinguishes between ‘small’
      tanks used in small to medium chemical processes, and ‘large’ tanks
      associated with refinery and other large-scale storage facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Separation distances are unlikely to give complete protection in the event
      of a tank fire or explosion, but should allow sufficient time for people
      to be evacuated, and for additional fire- fighting equipment and emergency
      procedures to be mobilised.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, a large tank should be at least 16 metres away from the
      site boundary, any designated non-hazardous area, process area, or any
      fixed source of ignition.

    <p>
      Underground tanks afford benefits over above ground tanks, in that the
      soil provides impact and fire protection, space is saved and separation
      distances are reduced. Disadvantages include the increased risk of
      corrosion, difficulty in detecting leaks, soil contamination, and the need
      for confined space access or excavation for all inspection and
      maintenance.

    <p class="ast-bold">Vents</p>
    <p>
      Tank pressure will vary during normal operation. Pressure may increase
      during filling, or if the ambient temperature rises. Pressure may drop
      during emptying or with temperature falls. The tank venting system should
      provide:

    <p>
      The probability of a major leak from a well-designed and maintained
      storage system is low, particularly if overspill protection has been
      fitted. However, as the consequences of a spillage of flammable liquid are
      potentially catastrophic, additional containment measures are essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liquid tight bunding should be provided for all flammable liquids with a
      flashpoint of 55°C or below, and for materials which are stored at
      temperatures above their flashpoints.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bund should have sufficient capacity to contain the largest
      predictable spillage. A bund capacity of 110% of the capacity of the
      largest storage vessel located within the bund will normally be
      sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Individual bunding is to be preferred to common bunding, particularly for
      large tanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smaller capacity bunds may be acceptable, where liquid can be directed to
      a separate evaporation area or impounding basin.

          Originally Intermediate Bulk Containers (IBCs) were intended for
          transport purposes only. Nowadays the use of IBCs for storing
          flammable liquids has significantly increased and they are commonly
          found in chemical warehouses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The storage of flammable liquids in IBCs in warehouses poses
          particular problems, notably:

              they are prone to early failure in a fire, allowing leaked

            <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
              they degrade over time, and so are prone to leaks when used for

              they are generally made of cheap, non-conductive plastic, so when
              non-conducting flammable contents splash around in transit the
              surface becomes electrostatically charged.
