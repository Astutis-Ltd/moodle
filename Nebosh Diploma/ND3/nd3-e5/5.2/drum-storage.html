    <p>
      Industrial nitrocellulose (other than water wetted) is a considerable fire
      hazard. It is easily ignited and burns fiercely, emitting large quantities
      of heat and toxic fumes. It may explode if incorrectly packaged and stored
      in a confined space.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burning rate depends on the type and quantity of desensitizing agent
      present:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Alcohol wetted grades initially burn at the rate of the alcohol, but
          as burning proceeds, the fire becomes fiercer
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Wet grades (water wetted) are relatively insensitive to heat and not
          immediately affected by fire, but once partly or completely dried out
          produce bigger, hotter fires
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Plasticised grades burn much faster and hotter than solvent wetted
          grades, and are more susceptible to ignition from frictional heating.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      The desensitizing agent must not be allowed to evaporate because the
      nitrocellulose becomes increasingly more heat and friction sensitive, and
      potentially more dangerous to handle, as it dries out.
    </p>
    <p>The type of packaging may also influence the fire behaviour:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Steel drums may vent their contents violently, causing short duration
          fireballs. Drums and lids may be projected considerable distances,
          particularly if venting occurs with the drum in a horizontal position
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Nitrocellulose in fibreboard drums burns more evenly than when packed
          in steel drums, the dimensions of the fire and duration of burning
          relating fairly closely to the quantity stored and the stack
          configuration. Plasticised material may be violently ejected, even
          from fibreboard drums. The main effect of violent ejection is to
          increase the flame width of the fire around the stack.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>
      All grades of nitrocellulose are incompatible with strongly alkaline or
      strongly acidic materials and oxidising agents. Contamination by any of
      these substances could result in decomposition and ignition of the
      nitrocellulose.
