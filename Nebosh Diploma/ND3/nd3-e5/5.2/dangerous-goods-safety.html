    <p>
      The ADR requires many of those involved in carriage of dangerous goods to
      appoint a Dangerous Goods Safety Adviser (DGSA). It applies to carriers,
      packers, fillers, loaders and unloaders, subject to certain exemptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Department for Transport (DfT) guidance is that final unloaders
      (consignees) will not need to appoint a DGSA, but that intermediate
      unloaders (such as freight forwarders and consolidators, and operators of
      ‘in-transit’ storage facilities) will need to have a DGSA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exemptions arise from ADR, and have been implemented in the UK by the
      CDG Regulations. The exemptions do not apply to international carriage.

          Exemption (b) arises where the main or secondary activity of the duty
          holder is not the carriage of dangerous goods (or related activities).
          Companies whose business is not the transport of dangerous goods, per
          se, but whose activities involve such transport will not normally be
          required to appoint a DGSA. Examples include:

      DGSAs must obtain a Vocational Training Certificate (VTC) after receiving
      appropriate training and passing a written examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Training courses for DGSAs are run by independent providers and by the
      trade associations for each mode of transport. Course lengths vary from
      two to five days, depending on the mode(s) of transport covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Department for Transport (DfT) approves the mandatory DGSA exams, and
      has appointed the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) as its agent. The
      SQA sets, marks and organises the exams, and issues the vocational
      training certificates for the whole of the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approved examination is set on modular principles, with regard to
      certain classes of dangerous goods or discreet industry sectors. The VTC
      will relate to one or more specific modes of transport – road, rail or
      inland waterway – covering the classes of dangerous goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      A VTC is valid throughout the Member States of the European Community for
      5 years, from either the date of issue, or from the date of successful
      completion of a refresher course.
