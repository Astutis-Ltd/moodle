    <p>
      Regulation 5 of DSEAR requires the employer to make a ‘suitable and
      sufficient’ assessment of the risks to their employees arising from a
      dangerous substance in the workplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      No new work activity involving a dangerous substance can commence unless
      an assessment has been made, and the measures required by these
      Regulations have been implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      The risk assessment must be reviewed to keep it up to date, particularly
      if there are grounds to suspect that the risk assessment is no longer
      valid, or there has been a significant change in the workplace, work
      processes, or organisation of the work.

    <p>
      The recommended risk assessment process in the guidance to the Dangerous
      Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations (DSEAR) follows the
      standard HSE ‘5 steps’ approach to risk assessment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section concentrates on the hazard identification and risk evaluation
      stages of the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazard identification (determination of the presence of dangerous
      substances) requires consideration of the following three variables:
    </p>

            Substance or mixture which meets the criteria for classification as
            hazardous within any hazard class laid down in the CLP Regulation

          <div class="ast-list__numbered__item__div">
            The physical and chemical properties of the substance or
            preparation, and the work processes involved, creates a potential
            for fire, explosion or similar energetic (energy releasing) event

    <p>
      Risk is the chance, high or low, that someone will be harmed by the
      hazard. The definition of ‘risk’ in DSEAR builds on the definition of
      hazard and ensures that the risks addressed are those created by the
      physical and chemical properties of substances and preparations which can
      lead to fires, explosions and similar energetic events, and the harmful
      consequences of those events.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of factors that should be taken into account when
      undertaking a dangerous substances risk assessment. These factors are
      detailed over the next few pages.

    <p>
      Hazardous area classification should be undertaken as an integral part of

    <p>
      The results of the classification are used to control the equipment that
      may be used, or the work activities that may be carried out in hazardous
      areas so as to prevent ignition.
