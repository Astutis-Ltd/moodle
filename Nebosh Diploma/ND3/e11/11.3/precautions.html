    <p>
      Irrespective of the demolition technique(s) used on a particular project,
      safeguards are designed around the following key principles:

    <p>
      An exclusion zone is a designated three-dimensional space from which all
      persons, including the public, are excluded during demolition activities.
      It should be designed to be adequate for the particular demolition
      activities. The exclusion zone is made up of four areas:

    <p>
      For debris dropping, a radius of 6m, or half the drop height (whichever is
      the greater), should be kept clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where cranes, grabs, balling machines, pusher arms and similar equipment
      are in operation a minimum 6m width from the face of the building to be
      demolished should be allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For tall structures a distance of not less than twice the total height
      should be allowed along the proposed line of fall.

      <p>Method statements / safe system of work</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Following hazard identification and risk assessment a demolition method
      statement should be developed to specify the necessary precautions to
      eliminate or adequately control the hazards (i.e. provide a safe system of
      work).
    </p>
    <p>
      The method statement should be easy to understand and should be
      effectively communicated to and accepted by the workforce. It is equally
      important that it is understood and enforced by supervisors and
      management.
    </p>
    <p>An effective method statement will typically address:</p>

      Many demolition activities will be of sufficiently high risk to warrant
      permit-to-work controls.

      BS 6187:2011 â€“ Code of practice for full and partial demolition gives good
      practice recommendations for the demolition (both full and partial) of
      facilities, including buildings and structures.
