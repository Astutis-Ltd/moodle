    <p>
      Mobile access towers are widely used and can provide an effective and safe
      means of gaining access to work at height. However, aluminium and
      thin-wall steel towers are light and can easily overturn if used
      incorrectly.

    <p>
      Mobile tower scaffolds should be constructed by competent personnel in
      accordance with the erection sequence specified in the manufacturer’s
      instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towers should not be erected taller than manufacturers’ instructions
      (maximum height is usually a multiple of longest base dimension) and
      should only be constructed with compatible components, in good order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prefabricated Access Suppliers and Manufacturers Association (PASMA)
      have worked with the HSE to develop safe methods of work for tower
      scaffold erection.
    </p>
    <p>There are two approved methods:</p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          Advance guard rail systems, which uses specially designed temporary
          guard rail units, which are locked in place from the level below and
          moved up to the platform level
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          ‘Through the Trap’ (3T), which makes use of standard tower components
          with the operator taking up a working position in the trap door of the
          platform, from where they can add or remove the components which act
          as the guard rails on the level above the platform.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Safe use</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The tower should be used on firm, level ground. The castors should be
      locked or base plates properly supported. Outriggers should be used in
      accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barriers should be erected at ground level to prevent people walking in
      the area adjacent to the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tower should not be over loaded with heavy materials or equipment.
      Side loading should also be avoided as this will affect the tower
      stability, for example, supporting ladders, trestles and rubbish chutes,
      and strong winds, especially when sheeted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safe access must be provided to the work platform. This is usually by an
      integral internal ladder. The rungs on the tower end frames should not be
      climbed, unless specifically designed for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The working platform must be provided with suitable edge protection,
      including guard rail, intermediate rail and toe boards.
    </p>

      <p>Moving the tower</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The tower height should be reduced to less than 4m. The route of travel
      should be checked for overhead obstructions, poor ground conditions and
      other hazards such as moving vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tower should only be moved by manual force (pushing or pulling)
      applied at waist to shoulder height. The tower should never be towed by a
      vehicle. The tower should not be moved with people, materials or equipment
      on it, and should not be moved in high winds.

      The results of the inspection should be recorded and kept until the next
      inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      For towers over 2m, inspected after assembly or to comply with the seven
      day regime, the report must be written in the same shift as the inspection
      and forwarded to the responsible person within 24 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report must be kept on site until construction work is complete and,
      in any case, be retained for 3 months.
