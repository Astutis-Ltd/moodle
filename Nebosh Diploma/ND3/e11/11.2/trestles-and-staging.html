    <p>
      Trestles are made with a swing back similar to stepladders, but both
      halves have heavy cross bearers to support a working platform. Platforms
      should be of lightweight staging. Access to trestle platforms should be by
      means of a stepladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trestles can be used if the risk assessment shows that the risk of a
      person falling and injuring themselves is low, and the work on top of the
      trestle is of short duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steel or aluminium trestles are used in conjunction with scaffold boards
      or staging. Guardrail systems are available for trestles and if they are
      not used the decision would need to be justified by risk assessment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other supports, such as bandstands, are used with staging and are often
      referred to as trestles.
