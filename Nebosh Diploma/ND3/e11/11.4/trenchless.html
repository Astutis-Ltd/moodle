    <p>
      The need for excavation can be avoided at the design stage by using
      trenchless technology for pipe laying, or pipe repair and rehabilitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Horizontal directional</span> drilling uses a
      curved trajectory to enable a pipeline to pass under an obstacle, such as
      river or road, without the need for excavations at either end, as with
      horizontal boring techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Impact moling</span> uses a pneumatic piercing tool
      to create a bore hole. The approach compacts and displaces soil rather
      than excavating and removing it, therefore minimising disruption and
      ground reinstatement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Pipe bursting</span> techniques can be used to
      replace an existing, damaged pipeline with a new pipeline of the same (or
      slightly larger) diameter. The old pipeline can be burst in-situ, or
      removed piece by piece and broken up as it is pushed out of the tunnel.
