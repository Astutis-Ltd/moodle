            The excavation and any work equipment and materials which affect its

      Regulation 24 details the requirements for reports arising from such
      inspections. Following an inspection if the inspector is not satisfied
      that the construction work can be carried out safely at the place
      inspected, he shall, before the end of the shift within which the
      inspection is completed inform the person in control of any unsatisfactory
      matters and prepare a written report which includes:
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: Although an excavation must be inspected at the start of every
      shift, only one report is needed in any seven-day period. However, if
      something happens to affect its strength or stability, and / or an
      additional inspection is carried out, a report must then be completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The person on whose behalf the inspection was carried out shall keep the
      report, or a copy of it, available for inspection by an HSE inspector. The
      report should be kept at the site of the place of work in respect of which
      the inspection was carried out until that work is completed, and retained
      for a further 3 months.
