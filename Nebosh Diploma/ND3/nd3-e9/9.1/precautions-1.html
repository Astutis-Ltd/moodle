    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Dimensions</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The platform should be as small as possible, compatible with the number of
      persons that it is intended to carry and the work they are likely to
      undertake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forward length of the platform should be less than 2 times the rated
      load centre distance of the truck, and the width of the platform should
      not overhang the truck load wheels by more than 250mm either side.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Floor</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The floor of the platform should be of adequate strength, horizontal when
      attached to the truck in its elevated position, and slip resistant.
      Openings in mesh floors should be less than 15mm diameter.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Rails and toe boards</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      All platform edges shall be guarded by a top rail, at least one
      intermediate rail, and a 150mm toe board. The upper surface should be
      between 1 000mm and 1 100mm from the platform floor.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Overhead protection</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Overhead protection is likely to be needed if the platform is being used
      where there are risks from falling objects, or other overhead hazards.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Gate</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The access gate(if provided) should open inwards, upwardsor sideways and
      returnautomatically to the closed position. The gate should be
      self-locking in the closed position, or provided with an interlock device
      that locks the gate automatically, and ensures it cannot be opened once
      the platform is raised.
    </p>

      <p>Hand holds</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Suitably sized (to accommodate a gloved hand) and positioned handholds
      should be provided within the confines of the working platform.

    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Safety harness anchorage</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Work restraint anchorages should be included on the working platform. They
      should be of sufficient strength to comply with BS EN 795:2012 Personal
      fall protection equipment. Anchor devices, and should be marked as work
      restraint anchorages that are inappropriate for the use of fall arrest
      equipment.

      <p>People on the working platform</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The platform should be positioned to prevent the need for people to lean
      out of the raised working platform when carrying out their work. Work
      restraint harnesses will also help prevent workers from overbalancing and
      falling over the rails.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Method of securing</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The platform must be properly secured and locked on to the forks or
      carriage, in accordance with the platform and truck manufacturer’s
      recommendations.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Preventing access to moving parts</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Screens or guards should be fitted to the platform to prevent the risk of
      trapping and / or crushing by the mechanisms on the truck.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The truck / working platform combination should only be used on firm, well
      maintained and level surfaces, as gradients and uneven, or inconsistent,
      ground conditions can affect the stability of the truck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truck should not be moved while the working platform is elevated,
      other than minor controlled, positional adjustments. Note: Very Narrow
      Aisle (VNA) trucks, fitted with an elevated operator position and
      automatic speed limitation that are operating within VNA aisles, are an
      exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parking brake should be applied whenever the working platform is
      elevated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where applicable, the transmission should be placed in neutral before
      elevating the platform, and stabilisers and / or axle locking devices
      deployed as per manufacturer’s instructions.
    </p>

    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Communication</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Adequate arrangements must be made for communication between the truck
      operator and persons on the platform, especially when raising and
      lowering. This may be by way of hand held radios or hand signals where
      verbal communication is difficult.

      <p>Segregation of work</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The working area below the work at height should be segregated from the
      normal work activity. Warning cones, lights, barriers or signs should be
      used as appropriate, to prevent people and vehicles from approaching the
      work at height activity.
