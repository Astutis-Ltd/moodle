      Forklift trucks are both mobile work equipment and lifting equipment, and
      are subject to the requirements of Parts II and III of PUWER, and LOLER
      (see Element 7.2). The employer is obliged to ensure that work fork lift
      trucks are maintained in safe working order and are subject to proper
      inspection, maintenance and servicing, with thorough examinations at
      appropriate intervals, in accordance with the manufacturer’s or authorised
      supplier’s instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repairs and adjustments should only be made by suitably qualified and
      authorised personnel or contractors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on the nature of use, trucks should be subject to pre-use and /
      or weekly inspections.
