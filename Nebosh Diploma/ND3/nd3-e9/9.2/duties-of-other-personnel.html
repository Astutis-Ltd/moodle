    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The crane coordinator plans and directs the sequence of operations of
      cranes to ensure that they do not collide with other cranes, loads and
      other equipment.

      <p>Crane operator</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The crane operator is responsible for the correct operation of the crane
      in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and within the safe
      system of work. The crane operator should at any one time only respond to
      the signals from one slinger / signaller, who should be clearly
      identified.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an emergency a commonly recognised stop signal may begiven by any
      person observing a situation leading to danger and the crane operator
      should respond to that signal.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Slinger</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The slinger should be responsible for attaching and detaching the load to
      and from the crane load lifting attachment and for the use of the correct
      accessories for lifting and other equipment in accordance with the
      planning of the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slinger is responsible for initiating and directing the safe movement
      of the crane.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is more than one slinger, only one of them should have this
      responsibility at any one time, depending on their positions relative to
      the crane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where continuity of signalling is required and this slinger is not visible
      to the crane operator, another slinger or signaller may be necessary to
      relay signals to the crane operator. Alternatively, other audio or visual
      methods may be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where audio or visual methods are used, the equipment or its means of use
      should be such that the operator is immediately aware of failure of the
      equipment, to enable them to stop crane movements.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Signaller</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The signaller is responsible for relaying the signal from the slinger to
      the crane operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The signaller may be given the responsibility for directing movement of
      the crane and load instead of the slinger, provided that only one person
      has the responsibility.
    </p>

    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Crane erector</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The crane erector is responsible for working on the erection of the crane
      in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Where two or more
      crane erectors are required, one should be nominated by the appointed
      person or employing organisation as ‘erector in charge’ to control the
      operation.
    </p>

    <!--H3 Heading Start-->
    <div class="ast-heading--h3">
      <p>Maintenance personnel</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The maintenance personnel are responsible for maintaining the crane and
      ensuring its safe and satisfactory operation. They should carry out all
      necessary maintenance in accordance with the manufacturer’s maintenance
      manual and within the safe system of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally all personnel must be competent, physically fit and over 18
      years of age.
