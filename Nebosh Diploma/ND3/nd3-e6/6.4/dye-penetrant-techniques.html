      This is a simple low-cost method of detecting surface-breaking flaws such
      as cracks, laps, porosity, etc. To be detected, the flaw must reach the
      surface to be tested.

      Dye penetrant testing is one step up from a simple visual inspection. It
      is a simple low-cost method of detecting surface-breaking flaws such as
      cracks, laps, porosity, etc. and offers many advantages, such as speed,
      large-area coverage and cheapness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The techniques can be used on any non-porous clean material, metallic or
      non-metallic, but is unsuitable for dirty or very rough surfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dye-penetrant may be water-soluble, post-emulsifiable, or solvent
      removable. In each case the penetrant solution can contain a dye to make
      the indication visible under white light, or a fluorescent material which
      fluoresces under suitable ultraviolet (UVA) light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The liquid penetrant is drawn into the surface-breaking crack by capillary
      action, and excess surface penetrant is then removed. A developer
      (typically a dry powder) is then applied to the surface, to draw out the
      penetrant in the crack and produce a surface indication. Fluorescent
      penetrants are usually used when the maximum flaw sensitivity is required,
      and can detect cracks as narrow as 150 nm.
