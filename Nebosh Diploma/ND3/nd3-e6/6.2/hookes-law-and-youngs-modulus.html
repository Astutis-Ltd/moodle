    <p>
      In mechanics and physics, Hooke’s law of elasticity is an approximation
      that states that the extension of a spring is in direct proportion with
      the load applied to it. Many materials obey this law, as long as the load
      does not exceed the material’s elastic limit. Materials for which Hooke’s
      law is a useful approximation are known as linear-elastic. Steel,
      carbon-fibre, and glass are linear materials. Rubber is a non-linear
      material.

    <p>
      Young’s modulus (or tensile modulus) (E) is a material property that
      describes the stiffness of an elastic material. It is the ratio of the
      uniaxial stress over the uniaxial strain, in the range of stress in which
      Hooke’s law holds.

      As strain has no units Young’s modulus has the same units as stress, i.e.
      Nm-2.
