    <p>
      Maintenance simply means keeping the workplace, its structures, equipment,
      machines, furniture and facilities operating safely, while also making
      sure that their condition does not decline. Regular maintenance helps to
      prevent the sudden and unexpected failure of said items.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maintenance-related accidents are a serious cause of concern. Analysis of
      data from recent years indicates that 25-30% of manufacturing industry
      fatalities in Great Britain were related to maintenance activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undertaking maintenance activities can potentially expose the workers
      involved (and others) to all sorts of hazards, but there are five issues
      that merit particular attention because of the severity of the harm that
      could be involved, and because they are commonly encountered during plant
      and building maintenance.

      <p>Disturbing asbestos</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Exposure to asbestos fibres when drilling holes into the building fabric
      or replacing panels can be severe, as can the clean-up costs involved.

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Maintenance work often involves using access equipment to reach roofs,
      gutters, building services, and raised sections of plant and machinery.
      Falls from height are the major cause of fatal accidents in the workplace,
      accounting for 35 out of a total of 142 (25%) workplace fatalities in 2020
      / 21.

      <p>Falls of heavy items</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      The handling of heavy loads may not always be properly planned during
      maintenance work. Should heavy loads fall onto workers below the
      consequences can be fatal.

      <p>Isolation and permits to work</p>

    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Isolation and lock off arrangements, and in some cases permits to work,
      are essential to enable maintenance work to be conducted safely.

    <p>
      You may do some or most of your plant and building maintenance in-house,
      but there will always be tasks that are too big or specialised and require
      contractors. To enable both in-house and contracted staff to work in
      safety you will need to properly brief them on your site and processes,
      and you will need them to follow safe working practices.

      The image below shows the ‘bathtub curve,’ illustrating failure rates
      across the three phases of life: early life, useful life and end of life.

    <p>
      Maintenance strategies are required to reduce the likelihood of chance
      failures and to replace components before wear-out failures occur.
