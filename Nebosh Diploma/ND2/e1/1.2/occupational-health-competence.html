    <p>
      The level of occupational health expertise needs to be appropriate to the
      level of health risk identified for a particular workplace or project, for
      example: a complex workplace would usually have a consultant occupational
      health doctor (physician) overseeing the occupational health provision.

      There are currently three levels of qualification in occupational medicine
      for doctors:

    <p>
      Doctors who are members of the Faculty of Occupational Medicine and have
      made a distinguished contribution to the specialty, and who demonstrate a
      greater experience and expertise, may also be awarded a Fellowship of the
      Faculty (FFOM).
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctors without these qualifications, who rely solely on experience gained
      in the workplace, may not meet the requirements for competence demanded by
      some health and safety legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
      All occupational health doctors still need to work within the limits of
      their specific competence and seek more specialist advice when
      appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General Medical Council (GMC) website provides information relating to
      an individual’s registration and fitness to practice and the Faculty of
      Occupational Medicine should be able to confirm their occupational health
      qualification.

      <p>Occupational health nurses</p>
    </div>
    <!--H3 Heading End-->
    <p>
      Nurses who carry out occupational health surveillance should, as a
      minimum, be registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). They
      may also hold an occupational health qualification at Certificate, Diploma
      or Degree level. If the nurse does not have an occupational health
      qualification then they should work under the supervision of an
      appropriately qualified clinician (doctor or nurse).
    </p>
    <p>
      For a nurse-led occupational health service, the lead nurse should also be
      registered with the NMC as a specialist community public health nurse in
      occupational health (recommended minimum standard of qualification), or
      they should be qualified to register as such, and have access to
      specialist occupational physician advice as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) website enables confirmation of a
      nurse’s registration and qualifications.

    <p>
      Occupational health technician is a developing role. With supervision from
      occupational health qualified nurses and doctors and the correct training,
      they may be able to carry out some aspects of health surveillance. This
      frees up doctors and nurses for other tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occupational health technicians should be trained in the specific elements
      of the service that they deliver, and must be clinically supervised.
      Discussions on standards and competences for occupational health
      technicians are on-going.
