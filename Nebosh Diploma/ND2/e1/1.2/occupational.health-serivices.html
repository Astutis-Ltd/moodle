      Poor management of workplace health can lead to work-related ill health
      and to high levels of sickness absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The associated costs and the impact on service delivery makes sickness
      absence an important business issue, and a key indicator of how well an
      organisation is managed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Healthy, well-motivated workers are vital to the delivery of high-quality
      services. An effective occupational health service has a key role in
      achieving this.
