    <p>
      Employee health assessments provided by occupational health professionals
      comprise of a series of medical tests (such as cholesterol levels, blood
      pressure, lung function body mass index etc) together with evaluations of
      general physical and mental health to provide individuals with a better
      understanding of their health, wellbeing and risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many services will then work with the individual to develop their personal
      health improvement plan and can also provide support services including
      progress monitoring and access to helplines etc.

      <h5>The link between health and wellbeing and safety culture</h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      As has been discussed, wellbeing is largely about feeling good –
      comfortable healthy and happy, and is as much about the individual’s
      subjective sense of worth and value as it is about diet, exercise and
      healthy behaviours. The positive impact of leadership and culture should
      not be underestimated. Rather than compartmentalising culture consider the
      potential positive impacts of working for an organisation and leaders who
      value their colleague’s safety and physical and psychological health and
      wellbeing. Workers who are healthy and happy at work are more likely to be
      loyal, and more likely to contribute additional discretionary effort.

        Why line managers must be trained on wellbeing strategies and
        initiatives
      </h5>
    </div>
    <!--H2 Heading End-->
    <p>
      As with any other workplace initiative the role of line management is
      critical and line managers need to understand their priorities, in line
      with the organisations core values. In addition to training and
      development of awareness and understanding line managers also require
      sufficient resources, including time to be able to constructively play
      their part in any new initiatives. If they are expected to accommodate
      additional work without additional resources, it is likely that they will
      become a ‘bottleneck’ to the roll-out of new initiatives.
