      The everyday definition of wellbeing is
      <span class="ast-italic"
        >“the state of being comfortable, healthy or happy”</span
      >
      (Oxford English Dictionary).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in the USA notes that there is no
      consensus around a single definition of wellbeing, but there is general
      agreement that at minimum, wellbeing includes:

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the presence of positive emotions and moods (e.g., contentment,
          happiness),
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the absence of negative emotions (e.g., depression, anxiety),
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          satisfaction with life, fulfillment and positive functioning.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      In simple terms, wellbeing can be described as “judging life positively
      and feeling good.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Research Group on
      Wellbeing in Developing Countries (WeD) has defined wellbeing as:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        “a state of being with others, where human needs are met, where one can
        act meaningfully to pursue one’s goals, and where one enjoys a
        satisfactory quality of life.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      The definition means that any attempt to assess wellbeing or to understand
      the processes that affect it must take account of three dimensions:
    </p>

    <!--List Bullet Start-->
    <div class="ast-list">
      <ul class="ast-list__bullet">
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the material (e.g. work environment and equipment etc)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the relational (working relationships)
        </li>
        <li class="ast-list__bullet__item">
          the affective / cognitive (personal feelings and thoughts).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--List Bullet End-->

    <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) states that:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        “wellbeing exists in two dimensions, subjective and objective. It
        comprises an individual’s experience of their life as well as a
        comparison of life circumstances with social norms and values”.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      Examples of objective life circumstance include health, education, work,
      social relationships, built and natural environments, security, civic
      engagement and governance, housing and work-life balance. Subjective
      experiences include a person’s overall sense of wellbeing, psychological
      functioning and affective states.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a two-way relationship between wellbeing and health: physical and
      mental health influence wellbeing and wellbeing itself influences both
      physical and mental health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Improving subjective wellbeing is a worthy goal in its own right and can
      be instrumental to other positive outcomes – physical health, getting into
      work and productivity.
