    <p>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted numerous concerns about people’s
      mental health and wellbeing at work. The fear and uncertainty about the
      risk of infection and the impact of lockdown restrictions on day-to-day
      activities leading to job insecurity and isolation has made many anxious
      or depressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Fatigue</span> is a feeling of constant tiredness
      or weakness that is typically caused by a combination of lifestyle,
      social, psychological and general wellbeing issues. Excessive fatigue
      slows reaction times, impairs memory and negatively affects mood, often
      leading to irritability and anger. Shift-work and unsustainable workplace
      stress are both known to cause fatigue and mental ill-health such as
      depression. The relationship between fatigue and depression is such that
      it is often difficult to determine which causes the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="ast-bold">Chronic pain</span> and mental ill-health also
      commonly co-exist. Research has shown that people suffering with chronic
      pain can become depressed and also that long-term depression can give rise
      to persistent pain.

      Other considerations include violence, aggression, bullying and harassment
      which are discussed in Section 2.3 of this element and lone working which
      is discussed in Section 2.4.

        <p>
          Work-related stress is defined as a harmful reaction that people have
          to undue pressures and demands placed on them at work. By its very
          nature, stress is difficult to measure.
        </p>
        <p>
          HSE’s preferred data source for calculating rates and estimates for
          work-related stress, depression or anxiety are self-reports from the
          Labour Force Survey (LFS).
        </p>
        <p>
          Historically the HSE also collected data on work-related stress
          through The Health and Occupation Research network for general
          practitioners (THOR-GP). These data, although historic, provide a
          general practitioners perspective and still useful data on
          work-related causes of stress. The two data sources may reflect
          different perceptions of work-related attribution to individual cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the UK in 2020 / 21 there were an estimated 822 000 workers
          affected by work-related stress, depression or anxiety, a prevalence
          of 2 480 per 100 000 workers.

            <p>
              The LFS is a survey of households living at private addresses in
              the UK is to provide information on the UK labour market which can
              then be used to develop, manage, evaluate and report on labour
              market policies. The survey is managed by the Office for National
              Statistics in Great Britain.
            </p>
            <p>
              The LFS is intended to be representative of the whole population
              of the UK, and the sample design currently consists of around 37
              000 responding households in every quarter. The quarterly survey
              has a panel design whereby households stay in the sample for five
              consecutive quarters (or waves), with a fifth of the sample
              replaced each quarter. There is an 80% overlap in the samples for
              each successive survey.

    <p>
      In recent years prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the rate of
      self-reported work-related stress, depression or anxiety had shown signs
      of increasing and by 2020 / 21 accounted for 50% of all work-related ill
      health. The figures in 2021 plateaued and were not statistically different
      to the previous year (see image below). Evidence suggests this is not
      related to COVID-19.

      The LFS analysis shows that in 2020 / 21 stress, depression or anxiety was
      most prevalent in education and human health / social work activities.

    <p>
      Higher than average rate of stress, depression or anxiety were found in
      professional occupations, notably amongst:

      The main causal factors cited by respondents were tight deadlines, too
      much responsibility and a lack of managerial support.

      Although now dated, the THOR(GP) analysis from 2012 to 2015 has the
      benefit of GP insight following consultation. The five key causal factors
      of work-related stress and mental ill-health, as identified by GP’s were:
