    <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has described mental health as:</p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        “a state of wellbeing in which every individual realises his or her own
        potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work
        productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her
        or his community”
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--Qutoe End-->

    <p>
      Everyone has mental health, just as everyone has physical health. Both
      change throughout life, and like bodies, minds can become less healthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mental health and mental illness are not the same thing. Mental health
      refers to emotional and psychological wellbeing. It is influenced by life
      experiences, and can impact the way an individual thinks, feels and
      behaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mental illness encompasses a wide range of disorders often caused by
      genetics or brain chemistry. Each mental illness has different symptoms
      and can impact an individual's life differently. Mental illnesses are
      recognisable conditions that can be professionally diagnosed and treated.

          Mental health problems are common with one person in four in the UK
          experiencing a mental health problem at some point in their life. Most
          mental health problems are mild with anxiety and depression being the
          most common.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="ast-bold">Anxiety</span> is generally described as an
          unpleasant feeling when worried, uneasy or distressed about something
          that may or may not be about to happen whereas
          <span class="ast-bold">depression</span> is having feelings of extreme
          sadness, despair or inadequacy that last for a long time.

    <p>
      Often anxiety and / or depression are experienced as a reaction to a
      difficult life event such as moving house, bereavement, or problems at
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Work related stress and Common Mental Health Problems (CMHP) such as
      anxiety and depression often go together. Work related stress may trigger
      an existing mental health problem or cause it to worsen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stress and CMHP can also exist independently. Many people experience the
      physiological changes such as high blood pressure that are associated with
      work related stress without ever experiencing anxiety and depression.
      Others may be anxious or depressed without ever experiencing work related
      (or other) stress.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice, it can be hard to distinguish when 'stress' turns into a
      'mental health problem' and when existing mental health problems become
      exacerbated by stress at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally diagnosis and treatment through medication and / or talking
      therapies will be through a General Practitioner (GP). Occasionally
      sufferers may need to be referred for specialist help.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of people with mental health problems are capable of
      continuing to work productively. Evidence shows that employment can be of
      great benefit, both to the employer and to the employee.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mind is a 'suggestion engine' coming up with around 60 000 thoughts
      per day, or one thought every 1.5 seconds. Around 98% of these thoughts
      are repeated thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeated thoughts can change our perceptions, attitudes and beliefs which
      in turn influences our feelings and behaviours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mentally healthy people are able to properly filter through these thoughts
      and discard the bad suggestions by flexible thinking / cognitive shifting
      / having a change mindset that allows them to adapt to circumstances,
      change perspective and stay current and balanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mentally unhealthy people tend to have inflexible minds / fixed mindsets
      and are prone to cognitive distortions or suppressive styles of thinking
      such as worry, rumination and problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Healthy people are able to navigate themselves around and through negative
      thoughts whereas unhealthy people tend to get 'bogged down'. Everyone has
      the power to choose which thoughts or suggestions to follow and there are
      therapies available to help people struggling with suppressive or negative
      thoughts. As Dalai Lama XIV said:
    </p>

    <!--Qutoe Start-->
    <div class="ast-quote">
      <p>
        “If a problem is fixable, if a situation is such that you can do
        something about it, then there is no need to worry. If it's not fixable,
        then there is no help in worrying.
        <span class="ast-bold"
          >There is no benefit in worrying whatsoever.”</span
